Olive Bud Mite,Oxycenus maxwelli,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/olive-bud-mite-1.jpg,"Olive mites feed on succulent stems, buds and on the upper surface of leaves, damaging the growing tissues. Symptoms of an attack by these mites include the presence of spots on leaves, leaf discoloration and a curling along the midsection that give them the shape of a sickle. Other signs of an infestation are dead vegetative buds in spring, discoloration of flower buds, blossom blasting and abscission, and reduced shoot growth. Young leave internodes may be malformed causing a âwitchâs broomâ effect when observed from the distance. This pest is usually not a major problem as the olive tree will be able to stand the infection and recuperate on its own. However, in very young olive trees, a severe infestation can seriously stunt the plantâs growth.","Lady beetles and some types of predatory mites feed on O. maxwelli and can be introduced in orchards. Make sure not to kill them by using broad-scale insecticides. Horticultural summer oils can be used, which are less disruptive to natural enemies than  products based on wettable sulfur, as they have a shorter residual time. Oils should be applied to well-watered olive trees when the temperatures are cool.",,"The symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the olive bud mite, Oxycenus maxwelli. It is a minute organism (0.1-0.2 mm) that is not visible to the naked eye. It is yellowish to dark tan, slow moving, and has a wedge-shaped, flattened body that is typical of many species of this family.  Since they feed exclusively on olive orchards, their life cycle is closely related to that of the olive tree. In the spring, they move to new leaves and buds to reproduce and females lay about 50 eggs there. Emerging larvae and nymphs feed in numbers on flowers and can severe the stalks, making them to fall prematurely. Later, the mites can attack young fruits and cause discoloration and shriveling of the tissues around the feeding sites.",Regularly monitor the plantation for symptoms of olive bud mites.; Control insecticides in order not to affect predatory organisms of olive bud mites.,disease_images/Olive_Bud_Mite.jpg,400,711,JPEG,RGB
Anthracnose of Banana,Colletotrichum musae,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/anthracnose-of-banana-banana-1551112334.jpg,"The fungus causes dark-brown to black, sunken spots on the peel of infected fruits. Initial symptoms are visible on green fruits, and are characterized by dark-brown to black lenticular, sunken lesions with pale margins on the peel. On yellowing fruits, these lesions are of variable sizes and can coalesce to become sizable black sunken patches. Orange to salmon pink colored fungal growth appear in their center. The symptoms can also start to appear on the tip of the fruit and result from a former floral infection. Affected fruits can ripen prematurely, with the pulp becoming progressively affected by rot. The first symptoms may also appear long after harvest, during transportation or storage.","Treatments of fruits at harvest with biofungicides based on 10% Arabic gum together with 1.0% chitosan (a derivative of chitin) has been shown to partly control the disease during storage. A variety of plant-based mixtures have been used with some success to avoid the growth of the pathogen, including citric extracts,  Zingiber officinale rhizome extracts as well as leaf extracts of Acacia albida, Polyalthia longifolia and Clerodendrum inerme. These promising data still need to be confirmed in field experiments. Immersion of green fruits in hot water at 55Â°C for 2 minutes also reduces the incidence.",,"Anthracnose is caused by the fungus Colletotrichum musae, that survives in dead or decaying leaves and also on fruits. Its spores can be spread by wind, water and insects as well as by birds and rats feeding on bananas. They enter the fruit through small wounds in the peel and later germinate and initiate the expression of symptoms. Favorable environmental conditions for an infection are elevated temperatures, high humidity and frequent rainfalls. The symptoms may develop on ripening fruits on tree bunches or post-harvest during storage. It is the main disease affecting the quality of banana fruits during transportation and storage.","Avoid damage to the banana tissue during harvest, packaging and storage.; Use plastic sleeves after bunch emergence to protect them from contamination.; Clean processing stations and storage facilities to prevent post-harvest contamination.; Wash fruits with water to rid the skin from fungal spores.; Remove decaying leaves and remaining floral parts.",disease_images/Anthracnose_of_Banana.jpg,400,300,JPEG,RGB
Sugar Spot,Sugar Spot,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/sugar-spot-banana-1563886639.jpg,"The symptoms will appear after the banana harvest. Initially, small dark spots develop on the banana peel, which can enlarge over time. Brown spots can also be observed on fruit flesh.","No biological treatment is needed or available, as the fruit development process is natural.",,"The symptoms are caused by the natural ripening process of bananas. They continue to ripen even after they are harvested. The spots are signaling that starch is processed to sugar, implying that a large number of brown spots would mean a high level of sugar. The enzyme polyphenol oxidase or tyrosinase interacting with oxygen are thought to cause the brown coloration. The hormone ethylene reacts with the fruit's acids and breaks them down, resulting in the softening of the banana. The natural browning and softening process are even more obvious when the fruit becomes bruised.","To slow down the browning process, keep your harvested fruits in dark and dry locations.; Do not store bananas with other fruits that produce ethylene like apples or tomatoes.; It is not advised to store them in a cool environment like a fridge.",disease_images/Sugar_Spot.jpg,400,300,JPEG,RGB
Papaya Brown Spot,Corynespora cassiicola,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/papaya-brown-spot-1.jpg,"Initially, small angular brown spots appear on the older leaves and move gradually upwards. With the progression of the disease, the spots enlarge and turn light gray with a dark margin, the whole surrounded by a yellow halo. Their center can become necrotic and fall out (shot hole), giving the leaf a ragged aspect. In wet conditions, the spots grow much larger and join together, developing a target-like aspect. Elliptical, dark brown spots may also occasionally appear on petioles and stalks. Usually fruits do not develop symptoms, but in some cases, brown sunken-in spots may appear during prolonged wet weather","Extracts of essential oil of Ceylon cinnamon (0.52 Î¼L/mL) can be applied to control the size of the lesions on the leaves. It is very important to treat the crops before the fruits are infected, otherwise the treatment has no effect.",,"The disease is caused by the fungus Corynespora cassiicola. It is most common in the tropics and subtropics. It is a major pathogen of cucumber and tomato and occasionally affects papaya. It is spread by spores that develop on the underside of the leaves. The spores are carried from plant to plant by wind and rain. Heavy infections are favored by wet, humid weather. Extensive leaf decay can lead to yield losses and reduced fruit quality. Secondary hosts include many weeds as well as avocado, breadfruit, cassava, soybean or eggplant.",This disease is not sufficiently serious on papaya to warrant any preventive measures.; Avoid to grow papaya close to fields with tomato and cucumber.; Efficient weed management prevents the transmission from crop to crop.,disease_images/Papaya_Brown_Spot.jpg,400,711,JPEG,RGB
Peach Twig Borer,Anarsia lineatella,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/peach-twig-borer-peach-1.jpg,"First signs of the presence of this pest in the orchards may be the wilting of leaves or the flagging of new shoots in the spring. This loss of vigor in leaves, shoots and is particularly conspicuous in young trees. Later in the year, the damage can also be observed on older shoots and on fruits. In the latter, it is usually characterized by holes at the stem end, at the contact zone between two fruits or where leaves touch the fruit. The larvae  feed , boring shallow tunnels and surface grooves. In high population numbers,  they can cause extensive damage to young trees or nursery stock. The type of damage is very similar to that inflicted by the larvae of the oriental fruit moth.","Anarsia lineatella has about 30 known species of natural enemies. The parasitoid wasps Paralitomastix varicornis, Hyperteles lividus and Macrocentrus ancylivorus lay their eggs on the larvae of the peach twig borer, something that slowly kills them. Ants also happen to feed on the larvae. These natural enemies can reduce significantly the population of larvae, but often not below economically damaging levels. Therefore, timely applications of organically-approved oils, pyrethrin, spinosad or insecticides based on Bacillus thuringiensis can be used to supplement these treatments. The disruption of mating with sex pheromones can also be used as additional strategy.",,"The damage is caused by the larvae of Anarsia lineatella, a major pest in several tree crops. Adult moths have a grayish to brown body and mottled or banded forewings. Females lay eggs on young shoots, fruit, and on the underside of leaves, next to the vein. Larvae are small and have a brown body with alternating white rings and a black head. They overwinter in shelters under the bark, crevices on old wood or in pruning wounds. During the bloom period they come to light again and migrate to twigs and branches, where they attack newly emerged leaves, blossoms and shoots. They burrow down the tender shoots, blocking the transport of water and nutrients, and causing them to wilt and die. They can also cause the destruction of the growing points in older shoots, causing the dieback of the branch and in some occasion lateral branching. The life cycle of this insect include 3 to 4 generations per year.",Examine the orchards during spring to determine if the pest is in the orchards.; Open shoot to see if the larva is inside.; Use pheromone traps to monitor the moths.; Control insecticide use in order not to affect beneficial insects.,disease_images/Peach_Twig_Borer.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB
Sugarcane Scale,Melanaspis glomerata,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/sugarcane-scale-sugarcane-1703240498.jpg,"Stems and leaf midribs are covered by circular, brown or greyish-black scales. Leaves of infested canes dry up at the tip, with an unhealthy pale green colour. The leaves later turn yellow with a continued infestation. The loss of sap also leads to the non-opening of the leaves, which ultimately turn yellow and dry up. Eventually, the cane dries up and appears brownish-red when slit opens. Infested canes become shriveled and the entire cane is covered with the pest forming encrustation on the stem in case of severe infestation. Due to its sedentary habits and minute size, the insect escapes the notice of the cane grower. Its existence is only revealed after severe damage has occurred.","Dip the setts in 1% fish oil rosin soap emulsion. Spray white oils (foliage and stalks), which show some effectiveness against young scales. Release Chilocorus nigritus or Pharascymnus horni egg card @ 5CC/AC. 
Introduce hymenopteran parasitoids such as Anabrotepis mayurai, Cheiloneurus sp. and predatory mites such as Saniosulus nudus and Tyrophagus putrescentiae, which can feed on the insect scale.",,"Damage is caused by the crawler's scales. Females are ovoviviparous - which means that the young ones are produced by eggs that are hatched within the body of the female. Upon hatching, the crawlers (young immature scales) wander about in search of a feeding site. They attach their needle-like mouthparts, extract the plant sap and do not move again. The infestation begins with the formation of the internodes and continues to increase as the cane plant grows. Plant sap is sucked by crawlers. In severe infestation, the leaf sheath, lamina, and midrib are also infested.","Use resistant varieties such as CO 439, CO 443, CO 453, CO 671, CO 691 and CO 692.; Cultivate the setts that are free from scale insects.; Use clean planting materials to delay scale population build-up.; Keep fields and bunds free from weeds.; Drain stagnant water from fields.; Monitor your field regularly for signs of infestation.; Uproot and burn heavily infested sugarcane plants.; Consider crop-rotation with a non-host crop (e.g.; wheat).; Detrash the crop at the 150th and 210th day of planting.; Avoid repeated ratoons.",disease_images/Sugarcane_Scale.jpg,400,533,JPEG,RGB
Western Plant Bug,Lygus hesperus,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/western-plant-bug-1.jpg,"Feeding damage on developing flower buds and young fruits causes unsightly dimpling, pitting, scarring and sunken spots on young fruit. By harvest, the fruit is badly deformed, a symptoms that is often referred to as ""cat-facing"", and ooze may be observed on the surface. Internal fruit damage appears as white corky areas under the surface and decaying seeds. Feeding may also deform or kill flower buds and shoots, that shrivel and die, significantly reducing yields. These bugs have an extremely wide host range that includes stone and pome fruits, natural vegetation in uncultivated land and weeds in adjacent areas. These pests do not reproduce on tree crops, but invade orchards from these hosts.","Predators of these pests include big-eyed bugs, damsel bugs, assassin bugs, and collops beetle, as well as the egg predator minute pirate bug. Parasitic insects include Anaphes ioles and Trissolcus halymorphae, that lay eggs in the eggs of the cat-facing insects. Products based on neem extracts may also diminish L. hesperus and E. conspersus populations.",,"The symptoms commonly called ""cat-facing"" are caused by several species of bugs, among them the plant bug Lygus hesperus and the stink bugs Euschistus conspersus. Adults overwinter in protected ground covers. Early in the season, they feed on broadleaf crops or weeds in adjacent fields. Later in the summer, as these alternative hosts dry up, these bugs may fly into the canopy of pome and fruit trees. Adult plant bugs are flattened, semi-oval insects, yellow, green, and dark brown to black in color. The all have a conspicuous yellow or pale green triangle on the back. Adult stink bugs have a flattened shield shape and are gray to brown to green in color. Stink bugs are noisy fliers, with long, piercing-sucking mouth parts. They can be a problem in fruit orchards with ground cover comprised of broadleaf weeds, or in orchards near alfalfa fields or other host plants.","Choose planting sites that attract predators of cat-facing insects and avoid an indiscriminate use of pesticides.; Periodically monitor the canopy of fruit trees for the presence of adult stink bugs.; Critical times to scout are when the adjacent weed hosts are drying up or nearby host crops are being harvested.; Do not plant apricot trees adjacent to hay fields, weedy lots or uncultivated land.; Maintain proper weed management early in the season.; Do not mow the orchard floor within two weeks of fruit harvest as any bug infestation in the ground cover will move to the tree canopy.; Using a sweep net to catch the adults.",disease_images/Western_Plant_Bug.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB
Loose Smut of Wheat,Ustilago segetum var. tritici,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/loose-smut-of-wheat-wheat-1582814389.jpg,"Symptoms appear shortly before or during flowering stage and are characterized by blackened heads with powdery black grains and a peculiar ""dead fish"" odor. The developing kernels are replaced by fungal growth and no grains develop in the infected heads. It is a common disease throughout the wheat-growing regions of the world. The yield loss on infected heads is total.","Soak the seeds in 20-30Â°C water for 4-6 hours. Afterwards, dip them into 49Â°C hot water for 2 minutes. In the next step place the seeds on plastic sheets and expose them to sunlight for another 4 hours. The seeds should be completely air dried before sowing. This treatment reduces the infection risk. but it might affect the germination rate of the seeds.",,"The symptoms are caused by the seed-borne fungus Ustilago tritici, that survives in a dormant state within infested wheat seeds. The development of the fungus keeps pace with the life cycle of the plant. When the infested seed germinates, the fungus resumes growth along the shoots of the young wheat plants and eventually colonizes the tissues of the flowers. Instead of releasing pollen, the flowers disperse fungal spores that are spread by the wind to healthy flowers. There, they germinate and start to colonize the internal tissues, eventually being incorporated into new seeds. The infested seeds carry the dormant fungus but appear healthy. The cycle will start over again with the planting of these seeds. Other means of dispersal include harvest residues, rain and insects. Favorable conditions for the rapid germination of the spores are humid weather (60-85% relative humidity) with frequent rains or dews and cool temperatures between 16â22Â°C.","Use seeds from healthy plants or from certified disease-free sources.; Plant resistant varieties if available.; Make sure to clean tools, hands and footwear when working on different fields.",disease_images/Loose_Smut_of_Wheat.jpg,400,533,JPEG,RGB
Potato S Virus,PVS,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/potato-s-virus-potato-1575475070.jpg,"Symptoms of the virus highly vary and depend on several factors including the host, environmental conditions. In most cultivars, the viral infection remains symptomless. Some varieties will show a slight deepening of the veins, rough leaves, more open growth, milt mottling, bronzing or tiny necrotic (black) spots on the leaves when infected at an early growth stage.",Predators of aphids are numerous and should be promoted through good field practices. Aphids can also be wiped out by spraying the leaves of the plant with a mild solution of water and a few drops of detergent.,,"The damage is caused by the Potato S Virus, which is a Carlavirus. It is mainly transmitted in a non-persistant manner by aphids. It can also be spread mechanically by machinery, tools and damaging plants while walking through the field. Aphids are by far the most efficient means of transmission. Plants tend to be resistant to PVS later in the season.","Make sure to use plant material from certified resistant varieties, if available.; Keep nurseries free of insect vectors.; Practice good sanitation to prevent mechanical spread within the field.; Remove and destroy infected plants as well as any alternative host plants (weeds).; Do not transport suspicious potato material to other farms.",disease_images/Potato_S_Virus.jpg,400,223,JPEG,RGB
Bacterial Panicle Blight,Burkholderia glumae,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/bacterial-panicle-blight-rice-1582809338.jpg,"In the fields, it tends to develop in circular patterns. Small clusters of panicles do not develop properly during grain fill and the panicles remain upright rather than bending down with the weight of the grain. Infected grains can be unevenly distributed on the panicle. The stem below the infected panicle remains green. Bacteria infect the developing grains at flowering stage and cause grain abortion or rotting during grain filling after pollination. Grains develop a light- to medium-brown discoloration of the lower third to half of the hulls. These grains may later turn grayish, black or pink as other bacteria or fungi become established in the hulls.","Sorry, we don't know of any biological treatment against Burkholderia glumae. Please get in touch with us in case you know of something that might help to fight this disease. Looking forward to hear from you.",,"Bacterial panicle blight is seed-transmitted. The spread of the disease is temperature-dependent. Bacterial panicle blight tends to develop during hot, dry weather at later stages of the plant growth. Prevalence increases when daytime temperatures are above 32Â°C and night temperatures remain around 25Â°C or above. High nitrogen levels also favor the development of disease. Rice planted earlier in the spring tends to have less damage from bacterial panicle blight because of cooler temperatures at heading and grain filling.","Clean your field thoroughly from plant residues from the previous harvest.; Plant only certified, disease-free seeds.; Choose a rice variety with partial resistance if available.; Plant the crop earlier in the spring.; Control your fertilization program and do not exceed the recommended doses, especially for nitrogen.; Avoid overwatering.; Monitor the crop regularly and check for sick plants.; Consider crop rotation with non-host crops, like legumes.",disease_images/Bacterial_Panicle_Blight.jpg,400,533,JPEG,RGB

Green Lacewing is the most common predator used for successful control.",,"Damage is caused by Froggattia olivinia. It is common to spot different stages of the insect clustered on the down side of the damages leaves. Eggs that have over-wintered on the tree usually begin to hatch out in spring or late winter.  Adults can fly short distances. Feeding of the immature and adult insects causes yellow mottling to the leaves surface. The olive lace bug can have numerous generations per year depending on the climate. New infestations can occur regularly throughout the growing season.  All motile stages have piercing and sucking mouthparts, thus all stages cause damage.","Monitor the trees in early spring for evidence of insect infestation.; Apply control measures as soon as bug activity is notice.; Lace bug populations can build up rapidly if left unchecked.; Prune badly infested trees to facilitate control methods.; Pruning will also help rejuvenate badly damaged trees.; Regular monitoring of the pest is required on a fortnightly basis throughout the growing season, especially after a first infestation on the same season.; Pay close attention along the edge of the grove as population may move.",disease_images/Olive_Lace_Bug.jpg,400,533,JPEG,RGB
Brown Leaf Spot,Clarohilum henningsii,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/brown-leaf-spot-manioc-1667305357.jpg,"The fungus lives in diseased cassava leaves on the plant or those on the ground. It spreads to new leaves and plants by wind or rain splash. M. henningsii causes lesions that start as small circular, greenish-yellow spots. As they enlarge, they  become delimited by the major leaf veins and develop into angular patches. On the upper surface the spots are tan to light tan, of different sizes, and with a dark brown, slightly raised margin. Sometimes, minor leaf veins crossing the patches are seen as black necrotic lines. Over time, the center of the spots dries. In severe infections the leaf spots are surrounded by a yellow halo caused by a toxin produced by the advancing mycelium. Eventually the lesions may coalesce and engulf the whole leaf,  causing premature defoliation. On the lower leaf surfaces the spots are gray and less distinct.","No biological control measures are available to control the spread of the fungus.

Under greenhouse conditions, the preventive or curative application of products based on Trichoderma harzianum and Stachybotrys chartarum results in the reduction of disease incidence and severity (around 70% in both cases).",,"Stemphylium blight of lentil is caused by the fungus Pleospora herbarum, formerly known as Stemphylium herbarum, thereby the name of the disease. It is thought to survive on seeds or infected dead plant debris in the field. Beside lentil, this fungus can infect a wide range of other bloadleaf plants. An extended period of leaf wetness late in the season is essential for the development of the disease. The incidence and severity of symptoms also depends on temperatures, with the range 22 -30Â°C being optimal. In these conditions, 8 to 12 hours of leaf moisture are enough to trigger infection. In suboptimal conditions, for example air temperatures of 15 to 20 Â°C, the length of the moisture period can increase substantially (24 hours or more). Older plants are more susceptible to develop the disease than younger ones, particularly when they are under nitrogen stress.","Make sure to select clean seeds, if possible from certified source.; Select resistant varieties (several are available).; Reduced plant density to have a good airflow.; Ensure a good field drainage before planting.; Avoid excessive nitrogen applications which can increase disease severity.; Remove and bury plant debris through tillagen after harvest.",disease_images/Stemphylium_Blight_of_Lentil.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB
Cucumber Mosaic Virus,CMV,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/cucumber-mosaic-virus-zucchini-1.jpg,"Symptoms vary depending on the plant species infected and the environmental conditions. In some cases, the virus may be present but the symptoms are hidden or masked. Yellowish patches or light green and yellow mottling can be seen on the leaves and fruits. Longitudinal growth of side branches and leaf stalks is increased, leading to the downward bending of leaves and petioles. Young leaves appear crinkled and narrow and the entire plant is severely stunted and malformed, with a bushy aspect. Flowers may display white streaks. Fruits develop upward-arching bulges that render them unmarketable.",Application of mineral oil sprays on leaves can deter aphids from feeding on them and can thereby control the population.,,"The symptoms are caused by the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), which affects a variety of species (cucurbits,  spinach, lettuce, capsicum and celery as well as many flowers, especially lilies, delphiniums, primulas and daphnes). The virus can be carried and transmitted by 60â80 different species of aphids. Other ways of transmission include infected seeds and grafts, and mechanical transfer on worker's hands or on tools. CMV can overwinter in perennial weeds of flowers, and often also on the crop itself, in the roots, seeds or flowers. In primary infections, the virus grows systemically within the newly emerged seedling and ends up in the top leaves. Aphids feeding on these plants carry it to other hosts (secondary infection). The virus uses the hosts vascular tissue for long distance transport between different plant organs.","Use virus-free seeds and seedlings from certified source.; Plant resistant or tolerant varieties (many available for spinach and cucurbits).; Monitor fields and remove plants with signs of the disease.; Remove any weeds that show the mosaic pattern.; Remove other alternative hosts, growing near your crops.; Ensure disinfection of tools or equipment used for vegetative propagation.; Attach a floating cover to exclude migrant aphids during the early weeks of crop growth.; Remove the cover after this period of greatest vulnerability has passed to ensure pollination.; Plant barrier crops that will attract aphids.; Use sticky traps to mass-catch the aphids.; Cover the ground with an aphid deterrent material like aluminum foil.",disease_images/Cucumber_Mosaic_Virus.jpg,400,711,JPEG,RGB

Over time, the mold spread superficially on the skin and older parts at the center become bluish or greenish. The neighboring tissues become soft and water-soaked or colonized in turn by a broad band of white mycelium. The fruit rapidly spoils and collapses, or in lower humidities shrinks and mummifies.",Biological control of the fungi can be achieved with the use of formulations based on the Pseudomonas syringae strain ESC-10. Extracts from the plant Ageratum conzyoides are also effective against the molds. An 'essential oil' from the herb Thymus capitatus and neem oil have a similar effect. Tea saponin is regarded as a safe compound and has also been used to control postharvest decay of citrus fruit.,,"Two species of fungi belonging to the genus Penicillium cause these destructive rots of citrus fruits. P. italicum and P. digitatum grow on the fruit's skin as bluish mold and greenish mold respectively. The lesions of the former usually spread more slowly than those caused by the latter. Their development is also characterized by a band of younger white mycelium that surrounds the older growth in the center. These fungi are opportunist and take advantage of wounds on the fruit surface to start their life cycle. The spores germinate with the release of water and nutrients from the site of injury. At the optimal temperature of 24 Â°C, the infection takes  place within 48 hours and initial symptoms become visible within 3 days. Transmission can occur mechanically or via the  water- or air-borne dispersal of spores. These spores often reside in the soil but can also be found in the air of contaminated storage spaces.",Take care to minimize fruit injury during fruit work.; Remove infected fruit from the orchard.; Discarded fruits should be kept away from the packing area.; Keep fruits cool during storage to avoid the development of the disease.; Store fruit in high humidity/ low temperature conditions.; Use disinfectants to clean equipment in packing and storage facilities.; Do not harvest during or following rainfalls.,disease_images/Green_and_Blue_Molds.jpg,400,533,JPEG,RGB
Manganese Deficiency,Manganese Deficiency,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/manganese-deficiency-rice-1.jpg,"Symptoms are less dramatic than other nutrient deficiencies and depend greatly on the crop in question. The veins of middle and upper (young) leaves of manganese-deficient plants remain green while the rest of the leaf blade first becomes pale green, then develops a mottled pattern with pale green to yellow areas (interveinal chlorosis). Over time, small necrotic lesions develop on the chlorotic tissues, particularly near the margins and tips (tip burn). Reduced leaf size, deformation and curling of leaf margins are other possible symptoms. If not amended, brown necrotic spots may develop on the leaf surfaces, and severely affected leaves turn brown and wither. Not to be confused with Magnesium deficiency, whose symptoms are similar but develop first on older leaves.","Use manure, organic mulches or compost to balance the nutrient content and the pH of the soils. These contain organic matter that increases the humus content of the soil and its water-holding capacity and decrease slightly the pH.",,"Manganese (Mn) deficiency is a widespread problem, most often occurring in sandy soils, organic soils with a pH above 6 and heavily weathered, tropical soils. In contrast, highly-acidic soils increase the availability of this nutrient. Excessive or unbalanced use of fertilizers may also result in some micronutrients competing with each other to become available to the plant. Mn has an important role in photosynthesis and nitrate assimilation. Like iron, boron and calcium, manganese is immobile within the plant, accumulating mostly in the lower leaves. This explains why the symptoms develop first on young leaves. Crops showing a high susceptibility to Mn deficiency and a positive response to fertilization with this nutrient are: cereals, legumes, stone fruits, palm crops, citrus, sugar beets and canola, among others.",Check the pH of the soil and adjust if necessary to get the optimal range for best absorption of the nutrients.; Plan a good drainage of fields and do not over-water the crop.; Use organic mulch to keep soil moisture stable.; Always keep in mind that only a balanced fertilization can lead to optimal plant health and increased yield.,disease_images/Manganese_Deficiency.jpg,400,600,JPEG,RGB
Brown Rot,Monilinia laxa,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/brown-rot-1.jpg,"Symptoms vary depending on the crop and are mainly characterized by a blossom blight and a fruit rot phase. The first symptom of blossom blight is the withering of flowers, which turn brown and often remain affixed to the twig in a gummy mass. Infections may extend into the twig and can girdle it. If shoots do not die off completely, the infection is carried over from the blossom to the developing leaves and fruits. Leaves dry out but remain on the tree throughout the whole year. Fruit rot can affect fruits hanging on trees as well as stored ones. Soft, brown patches appear on the fruits. As the patches grow, white or yellow pustules develop on the tan areas, sometimes in concentric circles. The fruits gradually dehydrate, rot, and mummify on the tree. Stored fruits may not develop pustules and may turn completely black.",The eradication of the wounding agent is the most effective ways of controlling the fruit rot phase. Control of insects and birds that serve as vectors or that inflict wounds on fruits is one way to reduce the incidence of the disease. Birds may be controlled with scarecrows. Wasp nests should be sought out and destroyed. Particular care is needed in packing and storage of fruit because the fungus can spread between fruits.,,"Monilia laxa can infect many hosts, especially stone fruits like almond, apple, apricot, cherry, peach, pear, plum or quince. This fungus overwinters in dry leaves or mummified fruits hanging from the trees and its spores are spread via wind, water or insects. The infection is favored by the presence of wounds on fruits (birds, insects) or by the contact between healthy and infected parts. High humidity, rain or dew and moderate temperatures (15Â° to 25Â°C) during bloom favor the infection process. The development of pustules on fruits is particularly conspicuous in these conditions. Symptoms on fruits appear from midsummer onwards, either while they are on the tree or in storage. Stored fruits may turn completely black and not develop pustules. Due to the high risk of transmission, significant losses can be expected, both on the orchards or in storage.","Use healthy plant material from certified sources.; Implement a good nutrition program together with a proper irrigation.; Provide a good drainage and good ventilation of the field.; Use nets to reduce damage by birds.; Monitor the orchard regularly and destroy damaged branches or mummified fruits.; Avoid wounding and splitting of the fruits.; Late pruning with methods that increase ventilation of foliage is recommended.; Plow deep to bury plant residues under the surface.; Make sure that the storage room is clean.; Store the fruit in a clean, dry room at temperatures around 5Â°C.; Take care not to pull the stalks off the fruits when harvesting them.; Good general hygiene can reduce the chances of infection.; Check fruit in storage regularly, and destroy damaged ones.",disease_images/Brown_Rot.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB

Spots mainly appear on leaves but can also occur on stems, flowers, and tobacco fruit capsules. Spots are usually surrounded by a yellow halo. The spots start as small, pale-green circular areas, which turn brown in the centre due to tissue death. Spots can merge. In serious cases, the damaged parts of the leaves fall away, and only the leaf veins are left. Wildfire can affect the crop at any stage of growth, including seedlings in the nursery.",Alternative options for control of Wildfire are limited to the use of preventive measures and good field practices.,,"The bacterium that causes disease thrives in warm and moist conditions, often spreading after rainstorms. The wind plays a big role in how and where the disease moves. Watering plants with sprinklers can also spread the bacterium in a similar way. The bacterium can enter tobacco plants through natural openings or cuts made by insects. Once inside, the bacterium grows and spreads within the plant.

As the population of mites grows, the speckles, that are the results of the mite's sucking activity, can spread to the whole leaf. Leaves can curl upwards and the foliage takes a bronzed or rust-brown discoloration. The damage to leaves and buds reduces the photosynthetic activity of the tree and results in poor shoot growth, insufficient development of wood, poor ripening of fruits or premature drop. This increases the vulnerability of shoots to winter frost and reduces flowering in the following season.","Biological control through predatory mites works well on fruit tree orchards. Further natural antagonists include flower bugs, ladybugs, some varieties of capsid bug, as well as glassy-winged mirid bug (Hyaliodes vitripennis) or Stethorus punctum.

Slight swellings of lower stems may occur, as well as curling and the appearance of a mottled green and yellow pattern on the leaves. Roots may grow thin and woody, with thick outer layers, and deep cracks. Sometimes the cracks will form a ring around the root, hindering the transport of water and nutrients to the aerial parts of the plant and giving rise to the peculiar growth. .","Treatment of cassava cuttings or seeds for six hours in 0.01 % Streptomycin solution before planting is an effective method in lowering mortality of cassava plants and increasing germination rate in the case of seeds. 
Some parasitic wasps have been used to control the populations of insect vectors.",,"The symptoms are triggered by bacteria-like organisms called phytoplasma that can only survive inside the vascular system of plants. They are mainly spread by the feeding habits of some insects that suck the sap of the cassava plants, among others mealybugs. Another important way of transmission is through the use or transport of infected plant material between fields or areas. This disease can be a serious threat to the cassava industry in many countries.

The insect attacks the mango plant at all the growth stages from seedling to maturity. During feeding, the pest obtains the sap and injects toxins into the plant. The impacts could be higher during hot and dry weather than during rainy periods, especially on young seedlings and mango trees.","Select the appropriate field and a desirable variety.; Based on research from Asia and Africa, Ataulfo, Apple, Haden, and Keit mango varieties have been reported to be more tolerant to white mango scale when compared to other varieties such as Alphanso, Kent, Tommy Atkins and Dod.; Monitor the white scale fortnightly and prune the infested mango twigs.; Ensure optimum spacing so that plants do not compete for growth factors.; Pre-harvest fruit bagging can be applied as a physical protection method.",disease_images/White_Mango_Scale.jpg,400,711,JPEG,RGB
Peach Leaf Curl,Taphrina deformans,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/peach-leaf-curl-1.jpg,"Symptoms usually appear soon after a leaf burst. Leaves become thickened and severely distorted with a puckered, crumpled or curled limb and a reddish to purple discolouration, depending on the variety of tree. As the infection progresses, the affected leaves take on a whitish-grey, powdery appearance due to the development of a fungal bloom on their surface. The grey covering gradually turns black, a process that coincides with higher daytime temperatures. Eventually, the diseased leaves die and fall, leading to defoliation and loss of vigour. They are soon replaced by new leaves emerging from the same growing point. Areas of bark or whole shoots can also be blackened when the infection becomes systemic, during which the fungus will start to spread within the plant's internal tissues. In those cases, growing tips produce abnormal lateral shooting and the development of witch's brooms. On heavily diseased trees, the surface of fruits shows a dramatic change in appearance.","Fungicidal sprays containing organic copper compounds like the Bordeaux mixture can be used to effectively combat this fungus. The first treatment should be done after the fall in the autumn season and again in spring before the buds start to swell. Note that repeated use of copper products can result in a buildup of copper in the soil, which eventually can become toxic to soil organisms.",,"The symptoms are caused by the colonization of the plant tissues by the fungus Taphrina deformans. Spores produced on the leaf surface are washed by rain splashes or blown by the wind onto peach twigs and buds, initiating new infections. The spores germinate during frequent rains as the buds open in the spring and infect the still unfolded leaves. From the moment the spore enters the leaf bud, there is no effective countermeasure to stop the infectious process. If rain does not occur at this time, the spores remain inactive and little or no infection occurs. Lodged in bud scales or crevices in the bark throughout the summer and following winter, they eventually germinate during the next season. The fungus is only active at temperatures up to 16Â°C and can only reproduce at these low temperatures. Taphrina deformans infects peaches and nectarines, also almonds and occasionally apricots and ornamental Prunus.","Protect the plants from rain or overhead irrigation during the bud swelling phase.; Prune the tree crown every year to allow for proper ventilation of the foliage.; Use moderate amounts of fertilizer.; Use plant fortifiers before bud swelling.; Plant resilient varieties, for example, white flesh varieties.; Remove and destroy all obviously infected leaves, mummified fruits and shoots.; Whenever possible, use a rain shelter of plastic to prevent infection.",disease_images/Peach_Leaf_Curl.jpg,400,711,JPEG,RGB

These can be injuries caused by adverse weather conditions (freezing, hail), mechanical friction of roots or injuries during field work (pruning, graft unions, removal of suckers). The bacteria can grown in living wood and plant tissues for years without causing symptoms. Thus, the transmission of the disease between areas may happen through the transport of apparently healthy cuttings. It is crucial to select an appropriate site to avoid the worst effects of the disease.

Unlike most aphids, it sucks sap from the woody stems and shoots, rather than from foliage. This insect is characterized by its white, thick, fluffy wax covering. It overwinters on its host in cracks on the bark or on suberised wounds around old feeding sites. As temperatures increase in the spring, the aphids become active again and climb on the suckers,  younger shoots and branches in search of a vulnerable sites (areas with thinner bark). There, it feeds gregariously, sucking sap from beneath the bark, and starts secreting the fluffy hairs that eventually wrapped the colony. Opportunistic pathogen can then colonize these open wounds. During the summer, the adults grow wings and fly off in search of new host plants. Elm trees in the vicinity of orchards increase the migration of the aphid to apple orchards.","Choose resistant varieties if available.; In mild infestations, the insect can be monitored and scrubbed with a brush.; Apply fortifiers or balanced fertilization to strengthen the plants.; Avoid the excessive usage of pesticides as they can decrease populations of beneficial insects.; Summer prune in late summer to remove developing colonies.; Remove affected young shoots and branches.; Remove suckers at the base of the plant to create less favorable conditions for the aphids.; Paint large pruning cuts with commercial pruning paint to discourage aphid colonies.; Do not plant elm trees close to apple tree orchards.",disease_images/Woolly_Aphid.jpg,400,532,JPEG,RGB

The larvae of these insects are xylophagous, meaning that they feed from the sapwood below the bark. Adults are dull reddish-brown, with a black head and about 2.5-4.5 mm long. Females usually choose weakened trees, pierce a hole through the bark and bore a tunnel into the sapwood. The eggs are laid along this mother gallery, which can reach up to 10 cm in length. After hatching, the larvae bore slightly shorter and narrower galleries underneath the bark, starting from the mother tunnel and nearly perpendicular to it. In spring, the larvae pupate in a nest there. At constant warm temperatures, the adult beetles hatch, bore a tunnel through the bark and fly to other suitable trees to start a new cycle.

Control ring nematodes.,,"Bacterial canker is a disease caused by two closely related bacteria that infect leaves and stems of plums, cherries and related Prunus species. These bacteria usually dwell on the surface of the leaves. During wet weather in spring or early summer, it can enter through the leaf natural pores, causing infections to develop in the young leaves. As the leaf matures, these infections are revealed as small patches of diseased tissue that gradually becomes necrotic. The ongoing expansion of the leaf leads to the tearing and fall of these dead patches. Cankers develop on shoots when the bacteria gain entry to the tissues through wounds or leaf scars at the time of leaf fall. Cankers remain more or less dormant through summer, when tissues are resistant, and during autumn and winter when temperatures are low. In spring, the bacterium resumes growth and infections spread rapidly, killing the bark.","Only use seeds or shoots from certified nurseries.; Plant resilient varieties, if available in the area.; Choose locations exposed to the wind to decrease humidity.; Monitor the orchard for symptoms of the disease on a regular basis.; Avoid nitrogen-rich fertilizers but still fertilize accordingly.; Cut off all cankered areas down to the healthy wood.; Prune soon after the harvest so that wounds can heal better.; In both cases, seal pruning wounds with an appropriate paint.; Destroy the affected tree material by burning or throwing it to a landfill.",disease_images/Bacterial_Canker.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB
Root and Foot Rot,Cochliobolus sativus,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/root-and-foot-rot-1.jpg,"Symptoms will depend on the environmental conditions and the plant growth stage. In some cases, contaminated seeds can give rise to seedling blight, which is characterized by the appearance of dark brown areas on young plants. Early infection of mature plants may not produce symptoms, except for a decrease in leaf area and number of tillers. However, dark-brown areas may be present at the base of the stem (foot rot) or below ground, and on internodes and roots (root rot). Later on, as the pathogen progresses into the stem, elongated, brown-black spots appear on lower leaves. This is particularly evident during prolonged periods of rain. Diseased plants occur randomly or in irregular patches, and are stunted and often chlorotic. A common symptom of late infections is the premature bleaching of one or more spikelets or the entire head (head blight).",The fungus of Sporobolomyces roseus is a natural enemy of Cochliobolus sativus and has been used in cereals to reduce the incidence and severity of the disease. Other antagonists of this pathogen are also available.,,"The symptoms are caused by the fungi Cochliobolus sativus, which is common in warm and humid cereal-growing areas. It survives as mycelium or spores in soil and crop debris, and is spread by wind, rain splashes or irrigation water onto healthy plants. Beside barley, wheat and rye, it can also infect a number of species of weeds and grasses. Oat is resistant to the disease but can still contribute to the dispersal of the pathogen. When a susceptible host is found and conditions are favorable, its spores germinate and initiate a primary infection on the young plant or its roots. It penetrates plant tissues either directly through the epidermis or via natural pores or wounds. Infested seed or agricultural tools can also disseminate the pathogen over long distances and serve as inoculum for subsequent crops. The life cycle of the fungus is favored by warm temperatures (optimal 28-32ÂºC).",Be aware of quarantine regulation for this pathogen.; Select certified disease-free seeds.; Have a proper fertilization program with split application of nitrogen.; Make sure to add micronutrient to fortify your crop.,disease_images/Root_and_Foot_Rot.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB

An elongate, brown, diffuse and sunken cankers appears at the base of the shoots, often surrounded by a concentric pattern. The bark of the shoot tissues hardens, a process called suberosis. Most fruit on infected shoots shrivel and drop off as the shoots desiccate.",Organic products based on different species of Trichoderma can significantly reduce the  growth of F. amygdali if applied in a timely manner. Copper compounds can also be used as sprays once the disease has been detected.,,"The  pathogen can infect almond and peach twigs either through leaf wounds in fall and bud scale scars, blossoms, and fruit scars in spring. However, direct infection through dormant buds is also possible. Symptoms appear in early summer and become increasingly evident as more blighted shoots appear during the season. The actual symptoms (constriction of shoots, gummosis and suberosis of bark, wilting and blight of leaves and blossoms) are not produced by the growth of the fungus but the production of a toxin named fusicoccin that is transported via the vascular tissues to the rest of the twigs.","Chose resistant varieties, if available in the area.; Monitor the orchard regularly for symptoms of the disease.; Remove severely infected twigs and shoots and destroy them far away from the orchard (by deep burying or burning).; Cut branches a few centimeters from infected areas.",disease_images/Twig_Canker_of_Peach.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB
Leaf-footed Bugs,Coreidae,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/leaf-footed-bugs-bitter_gourd-1681738951.jpg,"Leaf-footed bugs can cause a range of symptoms in crops, depending on the species of bug, the stage of development, and the type of plant being affected. Here are some common symptoms of leaf-footed bug damage in crops. Leaf-footed bugs can cause slowed growth in plants, particularly in young plants that are still developing. This can result in smaller yields or a delayed harvest. These bugs can cause discoloration and deformity in fruit. Affected fruit may appear discolored, misshapen, or have small sunken areas on the surface. This can make the fruit less marketable because of these visible damages. Leaf-footed bugs can cause damage to the leaves and stems of plants. This can result in yellowing or browning of the leaves, wilting, and even death of the plant.
In addition, some species of leaf-footed bugs can transmit plant diseases, which can further damage crops and reduce yields.","Insecticidal soap or botanicals, such as neem oil or pyrethrin, may provide some control of young nymphs only. One of the best ways to control leaf-footed bugs is to remove their eggs.",,"Leaf-footed bugs are insects that have flattened, leaf-shaped back legs.. They are medium-sized insects, usually about 20 mm long. They are usually brown or green, and they feed on the sap of plants, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts. The life cycle of a leaf-footed bug starts when the female lays eggs on plants. The eggs are about 1.4 mm long, oval-shaped, bronze to dark brown and are laid in rows. The eggs hatch into small nymphs, which look like smaller versions of the adult bugs. The nymphs go through several transformations before becoming adults. During each transformation, the nymph sheds its old skin and grows a new one. As they grow, they start to look more like adults, and they develop wings. Once the leaf-footed bugs become adults, they mate and lay eggs, and the cycle starts again. Leaf-footed bugs can go through several generations per year, depending on the climate and the availability of food. They are more likely to cause problems when it rains a lot. Adults come out of hiding in the spring after spending the winter under dead plants or mulch. If the winter is warm, more adult insects survive and can cause more problems. Some types of leaf-footed bugs only reproduce on weeds, while others reproduce on vegetables. Fruit damage is the main concern with these insects, and they are most likely to cause problems around the time that the fruits start to form.","Check your plants regularly for signs of leaf-footed bug activity, such as egg masses, discolored fruit, sunken areas on fruit, and damage to leaves and stems.
You can use physical barriers, such as row covers or netting, to keep leaf-footed bugs away from your plants.
Remove weeds from your fields because leaf-footed bugs can hide and feed on weeds.
Keep your fields clean by removing fallen fruit or other debris that could attract leaf-footed bugs.
Attract or introduce natural predators (birds, spiders, and predatory insects) that can help control leaf-footed bugs by providing shelter and water.
Practice good field sanitation as the end of the season to reduce the chances of the insect to survive until the next season.",disease_images/Leaf-footed_Bugs.jpg,400,533,JPEG,RGB

This peculiar-looking grasshopper, distinguished by its cone-shaped head, is typically found in Asia, thriving in reeds and grasses near rivers or streams. It is mainly active during the day and feeds on plants, making it a minor pest in gardens and a significant pest in tobacco nurseries and other crops. The tobacco grasshopper breeds year-round, with most hatching in the spring. However, their survival can be threatened by cool, wet conditions that kill many hatchlings, or dry springs that limit available food. Both adult and young grasshoppers contribute to plant damage.","Keep the nursery area and the field clean and free of weeds and grasses.; Cover nurseries with netting to prevent grasshoppers from reaching the more susceptible young plants.; Plant flowers like marigolds, calendula, sunflower, aster, alyssum, or dill attract beneficial insects that naturally control grasshopper populations.; Provide water sources and suitable nesting habitats in your field to attract birds such as kestrels and larks.; These birds help reduce grasshopper populations by eating large quantities of them.",disease_images/Tobacco_grasshopper.jpg,400,710,JPEG,RGB
Damping-Off of Seedlings,Pythium spp.,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/damping-off-of-seedlings-tomato-1550839547.jpg,"Damping-off can occur in two phases during seedling development, during pre-emergence or post-emergence. In the pre-emergence phase, the fungus colonizes the seeds just after sowing, causing seed rot and stopping germination. In the post-emergence phase, seedlings grow poorly and the base of the stem starts to rot. The stem is visible as soft and slimy with water-soaked, grey, brown or black lesions. Young plants or trees become chlorotic and start to wilt, eventually toppling down, appearing as if they have been cut off at the base. White or grey mold-like growth appears on dead plants or on the soil surface. When seedling loss is extensive, replanting may be necessary.","Biofungicides based on fungi Trichoderma viride, Beauveria bassiana or the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis can be used as seed treatment or applied around the root zone at the time of planting to prevent or control the pre-emergence form of damping off. In some cases, the preventive treatment of seeds with copper fungicides such as copper oxychloride or Bordeaux mixture help to reduce the incidence and severity of the disease. Homemade solutions based on plant extracts of Eupatorium cannabinum completely inhibit the growth of the fungus.",,"Damping-off can affect several crops and is caused by fungi of the genus Pythium, which can survive for several years in soil or plant residues. They thrive when weather is warm and rainy, soils are excessively moist and plants are densely sown. Stressful conditions, such as water-logging or high nitrogen application, weaken the plants and also favor the development of the disease. Spores are disseminated via contaminated tools or equipment and mud on clothes or shoes. Event though they can attack crops during their whole life cycle, germinating seeds or young seedlings are more susceptible. The disease is not necessarily carried over from one season to another in the same place, but rather appears when and where conditions favor infection.","Use seeds from healthy plants or from certified sources.; Use resistant varieties if available.; Use raised beds in sites with poor drainage or with wet soils.; Keep a wider space between seeds or seedlings at planting to favor the drying of the canopy.; Do not plant seedlings too deep when transplanting.; Remove infected plants as the first symptoms appear.; Plan a balanced fertilization with split nitrogen applications.; Water regularly but superficially.; Water early in the morning so that the soil surface is dry by evening.; Adopt the ring method of irrigation so that the water does not come in direct contact with the stem.; Take care not to inadvertently transport mud from one field to another.; Thoroughly disinfect tools and equipment, with household bleach for example.; Remove and destroy plant residues after harvest.; Plan a crop rotation with non-susceptible plants.; If possible, expose seedbed soils to solar radiation with a plastic mulch.",disease_images/Damping-Off_of_Seedlings.jpg,400,532,JPEG,RGB

Zinc Deficiency,Zinc Deficiency,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/zinc-deficiency-peanut-1.jpg,"Zinc deficiency symptoms vary between species but several effects can be generalized. Many species show yellowing of leaves, often with main leaf veins remaining green. In some species, young leaves are the most affected, but in others both old and new leaves show the symptoms. New leaves are often smaller and narrower and have wavy margins. Over time, the yellow (chlorotic) spots can turn a bronze color and dead (necrotic) spots may start to develop from the margins. In some crops, zinc-deficient leaves often have shortened internodes, so leaves are clustered on the stem (rosetting). Leaf deformation and reduced growth may occur, caused by restricted development of new leaves (dwarf leaves) and reduced internode length.",Application of organic manure to the seedbed or field a few days after transplanting helps to reduce the chance of zinc deficiency occurring.,,"Zinc deficiency is mainly a problem in alkaline (high pH) sandy soils that are low in organic matter. High levels of soil phosphorus and calcium (calcareous soils) also affect the availability of zinc to plants. In fact, phosphorus application can show negative effects on zinc uptake. The addition of calcium-rich materials such as limestone or chalk (liming) also offsets soil acidity and reduces the uptake of zinc by the plants (even though the levels in the soil remain unchanged). Zinc deficiency can also become a problem when soils are cool and wet during the vegetative phase.",Apply organic manure before seeding or transplanting.; Do not lime soils as this increases the pH and hinders zinc uptake.; Choose varieties that are tolerant to zinc deficiency or better at mining zinc from the soil.; Use fertilizers including zinc compounds.; Use fertilizers based on urea (that generate acidity) rather than on ammonium sulfate.; Make sure not to over-fertilize with phosphorus.; Monitor the quality of the irrigation water regularly.; Allow permanently flooded fields to drain and dry out periodically.,disease_images/Zinc_Deficiency.jpg,400,600,JPEG,RGB
Black Rot,Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/black-rot-cabbage-1562754705.jpg,"In most cases, the damage on the cabbage leaves appears only in late summer. The main symptoms show as yellow, wedge-shaped patches on the edge of leaves, later moving inwards onto the leaf and downwards into the stem. This symptom distinguishes black rot from Fusarium wilt, where symptoms move upwards from the ground level towards the stem. As the disease progresses, the yellowing part of the leaf enlarges and turns brown as the tissues die. Leaf veins turn black at the final stage of the disease, thereby the common name. Eventually, the leaf collapses. The pathogen may enter the stem and spread through the vascular system, something that is visible as a ring of black discolouration when cut near the soil surface.",A hot water bath for 30 minutes at 50 Â°C is the recommended treatment to sterilize the seeding material. This is not 100 percent effective against black rot but reduces the incidence of the disease considerably. The drawback is that it might lower the germination rate.,,"The symptoms are caused by the soil-borne bacterium Xanthomonas campestris, which survives in infected crop debris or seeds for up to 2 years, or on weeds of the Brassica family for longer periods. It affects a large number of vegetables in the cabbage family (including broccoli, cauliflower, turnip, radish, and kohlrabi). The bacterium spreads to healthy plants via water splashes and enters the tissues through different paths, among other injuries. Once a plant becomes infected, the disease spreads quickly to other cabbages. The first symptoms occur on the contaminated soils and seeds in the propagation bed. Environmental conditions favour the bacteria and the infection process are high humidity and temperature of 25 - 30 Â°C. Densely planted crops provide ideal conditions for bacterial spread to nearby plants. Under such conditions, crop yields can be reduced by 75 - 90%.","Make sure to use healthy seeds from certified sources.; Plant resistant varieties and avoid growing susceptible ones in the rainy season.; Do not clip transplants because they are oversized.; Provide the fields with good drainage and plant on raised beds.; Do not grow cabbage in fields that had broccoli, cauliflower, kale or any other member of the Brassica family for the previous 3 years.; Clean the field and surroundings from weeds, particularly those from the Brassica family.; Avoid using sprinkler irrigation and irrigate during the middle hours of the day.; Do not work on fields when they are wet to avoid disease transmission.; Monitor the fields for signs of the disease.; Cut old leaves that are in contact with the ground diseased.; Ensure that the tools are clean and disinfect them with bleach.; Plough and bury crop debris after harvest or burn them.; Control cabbage worms and other insects that can cause injury to the plant.",disease_images/Black_Rot.jpg,400,300,JPEG,RGB

The rot slowly colonizes the vascular tissue, and hard fibrous tissues with black fungal specks are visible between the internodes. The destruction of transport tissues leads to symptoms similar to water deficiency.  Plants ripen prematurely and have weak stalks, causing breakage or lodging. Upper leaves first become yellow and then dry out. Brown, water-soaked lesions are present on the roots. In cases of strong infection, more than 50% of plants can break.","Organic treatments such as farmyard manure, neem oil extracts and mustard cake can be used to control Macrophomina diseases.

Affected trees often show a general decline in vigor, noted by yellowing foliage, dieback of twigs and branches, and reduced leaf size and number. The decay and collapse of the wood may happen suddenly or over several years. Initially the diseased trees are scattered but due to the concentric spread of the fungus from its primary infection point, circular areas of diseased trees appear.

It shows varying symptoms depending on both the species of fungus and the host in question. The fungus survives on dead roots in the soil or the lower severed stumps for several years in the absence of host. They do so by forming resistant bodies called rhizomorphs. When conditions are favorable, it grows and produces thread-like extensions that spread in the soil in a concentric way in search of healthy roots.

Side shoots, leaf petioles and the lower side of the leaf may occasionally be infected. Leaves turn pale, wilt and shed, whereas severely attacked plants are stunted. Infestation in the field may show in patches around a cutting that was infested at planting. Heavy feeding by the nymphs causes the drying up and weakening of the stems, often causing them to break in the wind. The plant produces new shoots to compensate for the breakage of stems, leading to profuse branching and a bushy appearance of infected plants. Root development in those plants is poor, and the tubers become inedible. Symptoms are worse on plants previously weakened by insect attack and drought.","A 60-minute immersion in liquid extract from cassava roots can kill A. albus before the cuttings are used for planting. Immersion in hot water can also be used but this is less effective. It has also been observed that the vertical storage of stems reduced the infestation.

At later stages of plant growth, young plants may wilt and show signs of discoloration. Central leaves may have feeding damage or die while the outer leaves remain green. Stems may be shredded but still attached to the roots. In the field, patches with thin stands or simply bare plants are common. Most of the damage is done during early spring. In potato, wireworms can burrow into potato seed pieces in the spring and into developing tubers in the fall.",Some ground beetles and rove beetles will feed on wireworms. Larvae of stiletto flies (Therevidae) are also predators of wireworms. Some species of nematodes will also feed on wireworms. The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae seems to infect and kill wireworms. A granular formulation containing this fungus is being tested to determine its potential as a control measure for wireworms.,,"The symptoms are caused by the immature larval stage of a group of click beetles (Elateridae). Wireworms can be up to about 2 cm long, have slender, cylindrical bodies and are white, yellowish, or coppery in color. Females lay several hundred eggs singly among the soil particles during the summer. Loose and sandy soils favor their proliferation. The larvae feed on underground plant parts, germinating seeds or young seedlings for 2 to 3 years before reaching maturity. This often results in thin crop stands and lower yields. Beside wheat, they also attack maize, grasses and some vegetables (potato, carrots, onions). Crop damage is usually detected after planting, when it is too late to take effective measures. This makes scouting for wireworms essential prior to planting.",Plant less susceptible varieties if available.; Make sure to scout the field regularly and thoroughly prior to planting as this measure is essential to fight this pest.; Bait traps or balls methods can be used to catch wireworms and monitor their numbers.; Avoid to plant potatoes in a field with a potential infestation with wireworms.; Sow seeds into warm and moist soil to promote quick germination.,disease_images/Wireworms.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB

Please get in touch with us in case you know of something that might help to fight this disease. Looking forward hearing from you.",,"The symptoms are caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella citri, which survives in crop debris on the soil surface when no suitable crop is available. In the spring, when conditions are favorable, the fungus produces spores that are released by rain splashes, overhead irrigation or heavy dew. Wind can also transport them to other citrus groves. Once they land onto the lower side of a leaf, they germinate and the fungi slowly penetrate the tissues through the natural pores on the blade. This process is also favored by elevated temperatures, high humidity and prolonged leaf moisture. Several months can pass between the primary infection during the summer and the appearance of the first symptoms in winter. By contrast, cool temperatures and dry weather result in lower spore number and less infection. Leaves remain susceptible to infection throughout the growth stages of the tree if environmental conditions are favorable. The presence of rust mites on trees has also been associated with the disease.","Do not plant citrus in fields with history of greasy spots.; Monitor the field for any sign of the disease, for example canopy density and leaf drop.; Do not use overhead irrigation.; Keep the field clear of crop debris, fallen leaves and fruits.; Apply lime and extra irrigation after harvest to accelerate leaf decomposition on the ground.; Alternatively, apply urea to retard the growth of the fungi.",disease_images/Greasy_Spot.jpg,400,533,JPEG,RGB

Females gnaw a longitudinal mother gallery of about 5-6 cm in length (up to 10 cm), and 2 mm in width. As it does so, it lays eggs on small cavities in the sides of this tunnel. After hatching, the larvae bore slightly shorter and narrower galleries underneath the bark, starting from the mother tunnel and nearly perpendicular to it. This characteristic tunneling resembles a Mayan quipu.","Scolytus mali has a large number of predators but few studies have looked at their possible use as biological control in the field. Many species of birds predate on the larvae of Scolytus mali. Braconid parasitoid wasps of the species Spathius brevicaudis could also be effective to control populations. Other wasps of the Chalcid type could also be used (Cheiropachys colon or Dinotiscus aponius, among others).",,"The symptoms observed on fruit trees are caused by the beetle Scolytus mali. The larvae of these insects are xylophagous, meaning that they feed from the sapwood below the bark. Adults are shining reddish-brown, with a black head and about 2.5-4.5 mm long. Females usually choose weakened trees, pierce a hole through the bark and bore a tunnel into the sapwood. The eggs are laid along this mother gallery, which can reach up to 10 cm in length. After hatching, the larvae bore slightly shorter and narrower galleries underneath the bark, starting from the mother tunnel and nearly perpendicular to it. In spring, the larvae pupate in a nest there. At constant warm temperatures (18-20Â°C), the adult beetles hatch, bore a tunnel through the bark and fly to other suitable trees to start a new cycle. Infestation is a sign of an existing weakening of the trees, caused e.g. by fungal infection or unfavorable soil conditions.",Ensure a balanced nutrition to the trees.; Ensure sufficient water supply but do not overwater.; Do not store  firewood close to fruit trees.; Use pheromone traps to monitor the populations.; Trap trees or trap branches could also be effective.; Prune and burn infected branches or trees.,disease_images/Fruit_Tree_Bark_Beetle.jpg,400,711,JPEG,RGB

Leaves with chewed edges or irregular holes are characteristic for earwig feeding. This damage can be of little concern in mature, otherwise healthy trees. However, the feeding on young seedlings or tender shoot-tip on young trees may lead to stunted growth. Damaged seedlings may be missing all or parts of their leaves and stem. On soft fruits, earwigs cause shallow, irregular marks or holes on the surface that can extend deeply in the flesh. Their  activity is also denoted by black dots of excrement around feeding sites.

They sometimes hibernate in pairs in the soil during the winter and emerge when conditions are favorable. Females lay eggs twice during the season, so that there can be two distinct nymph hatchings, one in the late spring and one in the early summer. They feed most actively at night and seek out dark, cool, moist places during the day. Fallen branches or fruits, boards and densely packed weeds provide shelter to this insect. In areas with particularly hot summers, earwigs may be relatively inactive. Their presence or damage may go unnoticed until harvest. As omnivores, they also feed on insects, particularly plant-feeding aphids. Earwigs are both pests and beneficial insects depending on where you find them.","Monitor the orchard regularly for presence of earwigs.; Remove weeds from around the base of trees.; Keep orchard clear of pruned branches, suckers, loose bark, or debris under which earwigs could nest.; Remove tree parts that come in contact with soil to prevent access to trees.; Use a sticky tape around the base of the tree to prevent earwigs from climbing up to reach the fruit.",disease_images/European_Earwig.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB
Grape Berry Moth,Lobesia botrana,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/grape-berry-moth-1.jpg,"First-generation larvae feed on single flower buds in late spring or early summer.

They later penetrate them and hollow them out, leaving only the skin and seeds. Third-generation larvae (late summer) cause the greatest damage by feeding inside the berries and within bunches, which then gradually dry. Silk threads are spun between the berries to prevent them from falling. The feeding damage exposes them to infection by several types of opportunistic fungi or attacks by insects e.g. raisin moth (Cadra figulilella), fruit flies, and ants.

After the last instar, the larvae pupate in the web, fall on the ground with a jerk, and continue the process in the soil. The pupal period may vary between 5 and 15 days, depending on the temperature. Densely planted orchards have higher infestation rates than the normal-spaced and canopy managed orchards.

As disease progresses, these lesions gradually turn into brown, necrotic areas. The infection of stems results in black cankers that grow around the vascular tissues and girdle them, causing the portions above the canker to die and premature defoliation of the plant. A white waxy crust containing the bacterium may form on old leaf spots or cankers. Bolls may become infected causing boll rot, rotted seeds and discolored lint.

The number of spray applications depends on the amount of infested berries.,,"The symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the caterpillars of the grape bud moth Eupoecilia ambiguella and the colonization of the damaged tissues by the fungus Botrytis cinerea. The adult moth has yellow-brown forewings, with a conspicuous dark brown band and gray, fringed hindwings. Females deposit eggs (up to 100 per female) singly on flower buds or bracts during late spring or on grape berries during mid summer. The larvae hatch after 8-12 days. They are brownish-yellow and up to 12 mm in length, with scattered hairs over the whole body. Overwintering occurs as a second generation pupa in cracks on the bark or other suitable places. The life cycle of the moth is highly dependent on temperature and humidity. It is usually found in cooler and humid areas, and has only two generations per year. The optimum relative humidity level for development is 70% or higher and temperature between 18 and 25Â°C. Eggs will fail to hatch at low relative humidity levels and temperatures.","Check for quarantine regulations in your country and contact competent authorities in case of doubt.; Regularly monitor the grapevines for infested buds or berries.; Use pheromone traps to assess numbers.; Since the moth overwinters as pupae in leaf litter on the ground, remove and destroy grapevine debris to reduce emergence in spring.; Alternatively, covering leaf litter with compacted soil will prevent emergence.; Both of these options must be completed three weeks prior to bloom.; In light infestations, remove injured berries by hand.; Do not transport potentially infected material to other fields or farms.",disease_images/Grape_Bud_Moth.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB
Dusty Cotton Stainer,Oxycarenus hyalinipennis,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/dusty-cotton-stainer-1550423449.jpg,"Also known as cotton stainer, this insect and its nymphs mainly attack partially-opened cotton bolls, causing stained lint, boll discoloration, rot and occasionally, also shedding (partly due to the bacteria transmitted while feeding on the cotton sap). Further symptoms are underdeveloped, light seeds that fail to ripen properly. High infestations can cause a severe loss in quality of the harvest due to the stained lint, hence the common name cotton stainer. When feeding on other host plants like okra, common symptoms are a pungent smell and greasy secretions.","In Africa, some species of parasitic mites are found on the bugs, which become sluggish and soon die.

Initial symptoms are small, irregular black lesions on the outer leaf sheath near water level. As the disease advances, the lesion enlarges, penetrating the inner leaf sheath and  culm and producing brownish-black lesions. One or two internodes of the stem eventually rot and collapse (only the epidermis remains intact), leading to lodging, unfilled panicles, chalky grains or death of the tiller. Dark-greyish mycelium can be seen inside hollow, infected stems, with small, black sclerotia dotted over the inner surface.","Methods to control stem rot include good field management practices, and the use of antagonistic organisms.",,"Damage is caused by the fungus Magnaporthe salvinii. It overwinters inside the dead plant tissue, or within the soil. Later on, when the conditions are favorable (high moisture, high nitrogen fertilization), its spores are dispersed through rain splashes and water irrigation. When it lands on a leaf, it sticks to its surface and generates a germ tube that borrows through the leaf cuticle. This process is facilitated on plants with wounds as a result of wrong practices or insect attack. Disease intensity increases as the crop approaches maturity. In the tropics, periods of high moisture after harvest favor the life cycle of the fungus.","Use resistant variables.; Reduce plant density at planting.; Reduce nitrogen content and perform split applications.; Increase the content of potash to keep soil pH high.; Control weeds in and around the fields.; Burn any crop residue after harvest and do not let the straw decompose.; Alternatively, cut rice at ground level and remove the straw from the field in after harvest.; Another option is to plow residues deep in the soil.; Avoid stagnation of irrigation water.; Leave fields fallow for some months or even a year.",disease_images/Stem_Rot_of_Rice.jpg,400,533,JPEG,RGB
Alternaria Leaf Spot Peanut,Alternaria sp.,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/alternaria-leaf-spot-peanut-peanut-1.jpg,"A. arachidis produces small brown, irregular-shaped spots surrounded by a yellowish halo on leaves (leaf spot).

Spraying of 3g/l of copper oxychloride after appearance of symptoms is very effective against this disease.,,"These diseases are caused by three soil-borne fungi of the Alternaria species. Infected seeds can be the primary source of inoculum. If they are planted and the environmental conditions are favorable, severe losses can occur. The secondary spread between plants is facilitated by wind movement and by insects. Temperatures above 20Â°C, prolonged leaf wetness, and high humidity favor the spread of the disease. The incidence may be important on peanut crops irrigated during the post-rainy season.

The parts infested by this midge become covered with many small, raised galls or blisters. Each wart-like blister or gall is 3-4 mm in size and contains a yellow larva that feeds on tree tissue. In the early stages, the site of egg deposition appears as a small red spot. Heavily-affected leaves may deform, show reduced photosynthesis, and drop prematurely.  Infested inflorescences may be unable to open. The small exit holes on the underside of leaves are remnants due to larval presence. These exit lesions may result in secondary fungal infections.

Adult midges are 1-2 mm in size and die within 24 hours of emergence after copulation and egg deposition. Eggs are laid on almost all tree parts, but they are predominantly found on leaves. When they hatch, the larvae penetrate the tissues and inflict damage depending on the organ they affect. Floral parts that are fed upon can consequently dry up and fall to the ground due to extensive feeding. Mature larvae migrate or fall onto the upper soil layers, where they enter the pupal stage.

The crop is highly vulnerable at the early seedling stage, so the snails mainly damage direct wet-seeded rice and transplanted rice up to 30 days old. After that, the stems have become too thick and the snails cannot eat the hardened tissues. The snails usually cut the tillers first and then the leaves and stems are consumed under water. Other plants, like taro (Colocasia esculentamay) can also be attacked. The life span of this pest can vary from 119 days to 5 years, with higher temperatures leading to shorter longevity.","Mass snail and egg collection campaigns are very effective if carried out during land preparation, planting or crop establishment. Snails can also be harvested and sold as animal feed. Natural predators should be favored, e.g. red ants that feed on the snail eggs and birds or ducks that eat young snails. Domestic ducks can be put into fields during final land preparation or after crop establishment when plants are big enough.",,"The symptoms are caused by two species of golden apple snails, Pomacea canaliculata and P. maculata. They are highly invasive and can cause serious damage to rice crops. They usually spread through water pathways (irrigation canals, natural water distribution) or during flooding events. During dry periods, these snails bury themselves in the mud, and can hibernate up to six months, reemerging as water returns. The color and size help to tell these snails from native ones in rice cultures. Golden apple snails have muddy brown shell and golden pinkish or orange-yellow flesh. They are bigger and lighter in color compared to native snails. Its eggs are bright pink in color and are laid in clusters of several hundreds.","Plant healthy and vigorous seedlings.; Keep fields drained as much as possible during the vulnerable stages of the rice plant (below 30 days).; Alternatively, keep water level below 2 cm during this stage.; Transplant hardened, 25â30 day old seedlings from low density nursery beds.; Handpick snails and crush egg masses, ideally in the morning hours.; Place papaya and cassava leaves around the rice paddies to attract snails for easier picking.; Place a barrier where water enters and exits the rice field.; Place bamboo stakes to provide sites for egg laying.; Control insecticide use in order not to affect natural predators.",disease_images/Golden_Apple_Snail.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB
Powdery Mildew of Cereals,Blumeria graminis,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/powdery-mildew-of-cereals-wheat-1582819965.jpg,"Symptoms progress from lower to upper leaves and can appear at any growth stage of the plant. They are characterized by white, fluffy patches on leaves, stems and ears. These powdery areas are actually preceded by yellow chlorotic flecks on the plant tissues that can easily be overlooked during the scrutiny of the field. In some crops, the patches can appear as large, raised pustules instead. As the fungus completes its life cycle, these powdery zones turn gray-tan. Late in the season, conspicuous black specks may appear amidst the white patches, something that can be observed at a closer look with a magnifying glass. Lower, older leaves commonly show the worst symptoms because of higher humidity around them.","Milk solutions have been used successfully by small organic growers and gardeners as a treatment against  powdery mildew. Milk is diluted with water (typically 1:10) and sprayed on susceptible plants at the first sign of infection, or as a preventative measure. Repeated weekly applications are needed to control or eliminate the disease.",,"The symptoms are caused by the fungus Blumeria graminis, an obligate biotroph that can only grow and reproduce on a living host. If no hosts are available, it overwinters between seasons as dormant structures on plant debris in the field. Apart from the cereals, it can colonize dozens of other plants, that it may use to bridge two seasons. When conditions are favorable, it resumes growth and produces spores that are later scattered by wind to healthy plants. Once it lands on a leaf, the spore germinates and produce feeding structures that takes up nutrients from the host cells to support the growth of the fungus. Relatively cool and humid conditions (95% humidity) and cloudy weather favor its development. However, leaf moisture is not needed for the germination of the spores and can actually inhibit it. Ideal temperatures are between 16 Â°C and 21 Â°C with temperatures above 25 Â°C being detrimental. No known quarantine regulations exist for this pathogen because of its widespread distribution and airborne dissemination.  Densely sowed plants, excessive application of nitrogen and monocultures also provide optimal conditions for the growth of powdery mildew.","Choose resistant varieties if available.; Do not sow too early in the season.; Modify sowing density to allow for good aeration of cultures and reduce humidity.; Monitor field regularly for the first signs of the disease.; Manage carefully the application of nitrogen, as its excess in soil favors the growth of the pathogen.; Plan a crop rotation with non-host plants.; Eliminate volunteer plants and weeds from the field to disrupt its life cycle.; Complement the fertilization program with silicon or calcium silicate to strengthen the resistance of plants.",disease_images/Powdery_Mildew_of_Cereals.jpg,400,533,JPEG,RGB

These spots are often surrounded by a light green or yellow margin. As they expand, their center turn brown or rust-colored first and eventually falls out, leaving the characteristic âshot holeâ on the limbs that give the disease its name. Premature leaf drop can occur. Twigs may present dead buds, lesions or cankers that exude gum. On fruits, rough and corky lesions with purple margins appear, generally only on the upper surface. This makes the fruit unattractive and unmarketable. Tiny black specks can be observed with a magnifying lens in the middle of the lesions.",Spraying of fungicides based on copper in early winter can be the first defense against the disease. Homemade Bordeaux mixture or a commercial formulations of copper can be purchased. Zinc sulfate can be sprayed on foliage in late Autumn to hasten leaf fall and reduce the presence of the fungus before the start of a new season.,,"Symptoms are caused by the fungus Wilsonomyces carpophilus, which infects several species of stone fruits (peach, almond, cherry and apricot).  Alternative hosts are English laurel and nectarines. The fungus overwinters in lesions in buds and twigs or in mummified fruits. When the weather conditions are favorable, they resume growth and produce spores that are dispersed by rain splashes to healthy tissues. Extended periods of leaf wetness (14-24 hours or more) and temperature around 22 Â°C favors the life cycle of the fungus and its potential to infect healthy trees. Warm, foggy or rainy winters and heavy spring rains favor the formation and release of spores. The disease will actually develop on stone fruits trees only during unusually wet weather during the spring.","Avoid to splash water onto lower foliage during irrigation.; Monitor the orchards regularly for signs of the disease.; Use pruning methods that allow for a good ventilation of the foliage.; As soon as an infection is detected, cut the diseased branch a few centimeters down the healthy tissue.; Disinfect cutting tools and other utensils after field work.; Remove cut branches and wood from the field and destroy them.; Grow garlic or onions as repellent near the tree.; Alternatively, spray organic mulch around the trunk.",disease_images/Shothole_Disease.jpg,400,533,JPEG,RGB

Constriction Canker,Phomopsis amygdali,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/constriction-canker-1.jpg,"Constriction canker is found most frequently in older, established orchards and appear to be more common on certain varieties of peach trees. Reddish brown zonate or concentric lesions appear on the bark around the branch nodes of last year's shoot, usually by late autumn. Over time, these cankers become sunken and turn  tan to silver in color. Often, these zonate bands are speckled with tiny dark brown dots, corresponding to fungal structures embedded in the bark. These specks are not found in brown rot, a disease that also causes shoot canker. The necrosis may encircle the branches and lead to shoot dieback in very susceptible varieties, often associated with warm temperatures.

Great Southern White,Ascia monuste,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/great-southern-white-cabbage-1687164401.jpg,"A clear sign of an infestation is when plant leaves are damaged by feeding. The caterpillars of the Great Southern White butterfly are the one doing the damage. Usually they eat the edges of the leaves, starting from the outer parts and moving inward. This kind of feeding often creates uneven holes along the edges of the leaves. The caterpillars are capable of eating the entire plant parts above the ground. They are voracious eaters of cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli). Keep an eye out for clusters of eggs on the top side of the leaves and caterpillars feeding together in groups. You may also spot adult moths in the field.","Consider using Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) spray, a natural insecticide that targets and kills cabbage worm larvae while being safe for humans and beneficial insects. Apply neem oil spray, derived from the neem tree, as a natural repellent and insecticide.",,"The damage is caused by the caterpillars of the insect Ascia monuste. It is a very harmful pest that causes significant losses in cruciferous crops. Female adults lay groups of yellow, spindle-shaped eggs on the top side of leaves. This happens between November and May, which is the warm and rainy season in tropical areas. The caterpillars are yellow with gray stripes. The stripes run along their bodies and they have small black spots. The adult butterflies are white (males) and dirty white to gray (females). The adults live for about 19 days. They will travel long distances to find food, mates, and good conditions for those in juveniles stages to grow. Studies have shown that these pests do best in wet and warm conditions with temperatures ranging from 16 to 35 Â°C.  Yet cold weather and heavy rainfall make it difficult for them to survive.","Using resistant cultivars or varieties, if available.; Plant purple or red cabbage varieties, as they are less appealing to cabbage worms and moths.; Monitor plants regularly for signs of infestation, such as feeding damage and groups of eggs.; Remove eggs manually when found.
Preserve biodiversity by protecting habitats for natural enemies of the moth, such as predatory insects and birds.; Use floating row covers, preventing these pests from reaching your plants.; Use polyculture and companion planting by interplanting with herbs like thyme, sage, and rosemary, as well as marigolds and nasturtium.; Hang decoy moth traps to capture male moths and disrupt their reproduction.",disease_images/Great_Southern_White.jpg,400,533,JPEG,RGB

Some 2-4 days after the appearance of these symptoms, small chlorotic spots appear at the base of young developing leaves. As they grow, these spots coalesce and turn into stripes that run along the veins, often up to the tip. Plants infected at early stages are severely stunted, with twisted and distorted leaves and very short internodes. Multiple ear shoots and new tillers may develop, sometimes as many as 6-7 on a single plant, giving it a bushy appearance.

Damage may also occur due to wind drift onto non-target or sensitive plants. Phytotoxicity may also result when incompatible chemicals are applied at the same time.","When insects or diseases seriously damage vegetable plants, sometimes it is best to cut off the damaged parts or re-plant and learn how to prevent the problem next time.",,"Phytotoxicity frequently occurs when pesticides are sprayed under adverse environmental conditions for the plant. High temperatures and humidity in general will increase the possibility of injury from pesticides (insecticides and fungicides; especially soaps, oils and sulfur compounds). Cool damp weather in turn may increase the chance of injury by copper fungicides. Spray applications should be applied during calm, dry and cool conditions. Most pesticides are best applied below 25Â°C. Environmental of biotic stress (drought, insect injury) predispose plants to chemical damage.

Fruit cracking is a gradual process, and it takes place in three stages: the initial, middle and later stages of fruit cracking. At the initial stage of fruit cracking, a brown stripe begins to appear on the surface of the fruit and the cuticles fracture. Then, a crack becomes visible, with the oil glands starting to deform. The oil glands suffer severe rupturing after which tissues of the fruit surface and the cells are severely damaged and there is a larger space among cells of the broken albedo.",Reduce heavy losses by extra attention before and during critical periods.

The fruit size and shape index also have certain effects on citrus fruit cracking. Larger fruits are more likely to experience the cracking phenomenon. The influence of rootstock on citrus fruit peel creasing and fruit cracking is indirect. Daily variations in the light exposure intensity positively correlate with the daily fruit creasing. The daily fruit creasing rate positively correlates with daily variation values in light intensity. The higher average relative humidity before the physiological fruit dropping period will increase the occurrence of fruit creasing. Insufficient nutrients in the partial peel will cause developmental and metabolic disorders in the peel. Hence, the stimulation from an external adverse environment will result in fruit creasing and cracking.","Avoid moisture extremes by increasing the frequency of irrigation.; To get high-quality fruit and yields, micronutrient deficiencies should be detected before visual symptoms are noticed.",disease_images/Fruit_Cracking.jpg,400,711,JPEG,RGB

The contamination can also be caused from neighboring fields. Stressed plants are more susceptible. The distribution of symptoms depends on the dosage and can range from a few nodes to the whole plant if rates are particularly high. It is important to understand that herbicides can damage crops even in small dosages.","Be sure to know the type of weed you are dealing with (basically broadleaf weeds vs grasses).; Carefully select the herbicide that best fits your purpose.; Read the label carefully and follow dosage instructions as indicated.; Always clean the spray container after use to avoid contamination with a different herbicide.; Avoid spraying in windy conditions to prevent drift to other fields.; Use drift reducing spray nozzles that target the intended weeds better.; Try and test the herbicide in pastures and hayfields to monitor results.; Check weather forecasts carefully and do not spray in case of high air temperature and/or humidity.; Keep a log of activities with application dates, products, field locations, and weather conditions.",disease_images/Herbicide_Growth_Damage.jpg,400,482,JPEG,RGB
Striga,Striga hermonthica,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/striga-1.jpg,"Also known as purple witchweed, this plant is characterized by bright green stems and leaves as well as small, bright, purple-colored flowers. This plant parasites the crop and extracts water and nutrients from the host plants, resulting in symptoms that mimic those of drought stress or nutrient deficiency: chlorosis, wilting of leaves and stunting of the plant. Pre-emergence symptoms are difficult to diagnose precisely because of their similarity to a general lack of nutrients. Once the emergence of the striga has taken place, it is usually too late to mitigate the damage, even if it is pooled out. This can lead to significant loss of yield.","Witchweed is among the hardest parasitic plants to control, mainly due to the high amount of seeds it produces and their longevity. Affected plants should be uprooted and burned before they flower. The fungus Fusarium oxysporum may be used as a possible biocontrol of witchweed since it infects the early vascular tissues of the Striga plant and impairs its growth.",,"The symptoms are caused by the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica, commonly known as purple witchweed or giant witchweed. It is particularly problematic in sub-Saharian Africa. They can be a serious problem to crop cereals, grasses and legumes including rice, maize, pearl millet, sorghum, sugarcane, and cowpea. Each plant can produce between 90,000 and 500,000 seeds, which can remain in the soil for periods of over 10 years. These seeds overwinter in the soil after their dispersal by wind, water, animal, or human machinery. When weather conditions are favorable and they are within a few centimeters of a host root, they will begin to germinate. Once in contact with the root, the witchweed produces a structure that attaches it to the host plant, thus establishing a parasitic relationship. Nitrogen-rich fertilizers also reduces the witchweed infection rate.","Use fortifiers for a general strengthening of the crops.; Apply manure generously at the beginning of the season.; Sow plants of the genus Desmodium in the fields to prevent Striga from attaching to the roots of the crop.; Planting napier grass around the field also helps pulling striga away of the main crops.; Clean all tools, equipment, clothes and shoes carefully after working with infected plants.; Fertilize the crop appropriately with nitrogen.; Plan a crop rotation of your crop with pulses.",disease_images/Striga.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB

This interveinal chlorosis gradually forms a yellow to brown mosaic pattern that should not be mixed up with virus infections. On the lower leaf side, the water-soaked lesions that appear just beneath these spots slowly acquire a light-gray, velvety and fuzzy appearance during cool temperature and high, prolonged humidity. As the fungus extracts nutrients from the plant, it can cause the dwarfing or killing of young shoots, flowers or fruits and lead to stunted growth and poor yields. In contrast to powdery mildew, the coating appear exclusively on the underside of leaves and its growth is limited by the main veins. Moreover, it cannot be removed easily.","Commercial biological treatments for fighting downy mildew are available.

It is particularly destructive in shaded areas with cool, wet and humid conditions (heavy dews, fogs, precipitations) and temperatures around 15-23Â°C. The fungus overwinters in infected plant debris or shoots or on alternative hosts (crops and weeds). Wind, air currents and rain splashes spread the spores to healthy plant tissues during favorable conditions. Once they land on a susceptible host, the spores germinate and produce structures that enter the plant tissues through natural pores on the underside of leaves. There it starts to spread, eventually outgrowing the internal tissues and forming the characteristic mildew coating outside. There, spores are produced that will spread the disease even further.","Ensure that seeds and transplants are free from disease.; Plant cucurbit crops early in the season.; Provide good spacing between plants.; Plant in sites well exposed to the sun and choose right orientation.; Chose resistant varieties, if available.; Keep your plant dry, for example through proper ventilation.; Water in during the mornings rather than in the evenings.; Make sure soils are well drained and do not work in the fields when leaves are wet.; Keep the vines off the ground and properly tied.; Ensure a balanced fertilization for plant vigor.; Fortifiers can be applied to strengthen the health of the plant.; Control weeds in and around the field.; Remove plant residues from the field.; Wash tools and equipment and ensure field workers wash their hands before moving from one field to the other.; Avoid distribution of infected soil and plant material from field to field.",disease_images/Downy_Mildew_of_Cucurbits.jpg,400,300,JPEG,RGB

It is a major pest of citrus worldwide, common in the tropics. They survive after harvest on wood and leaves, infesting new growth in the next growing season. In their mobile phase, females are highly attracted by light in their search for a feeding spot. They do not lay eggs but gives birth to very active crawlers. Once settled on the upper side of a leave or on depressions on young fruits, they become immobile. After a short phase in which they are covered by a cottony substance, they eventually acquire their circular flattened form and their characteristic reddish-brown color. Their life cycle is closely correlated to temperature and the health of the tree. Thus, greatest damage usually occurs at the end of summer, when trees may suffer from moisture stress.","Use pheromone traps to attract females and assess the severity of the infestation.; Monitor your orchard regularly for signs of scales and scrape them off if in low numbers.; Remove heavily-infested twigs or branches.; Prune trees adequately to improve aeration within the canopy, creating unfavorable conditions for scales.; Place traps or obstacles to catch or hinder ants that cater for the scales.; Do not use broad-spectrum insecticides that could affect beneficial insects.; Minimize dust coating of leaves and fruits by watering roads and washing trees.",disease_images/Red_Scale.jpg,400,300,JPEG,RGB

This is a long-term approach to remedy sulfur deficiency.,,"Sulfur deficiency is not particularly common in either nature or agriculture. Sulfur is mobile in the soil and can be easily be leached downwards with water movements. That explains why deficiencies are associated with soils with low organic matter, highly weathered soils, sandy soils or soil with high pH. Most of the sulfur in soil is contained in soil organic matter or is attached to clay minerals. Bacteria in the soil make it available to plants in a process known as mineralization. This process is favored by high temperatures because of the enhanced activity of these microorganisms and their increased number. It is immobile in plants and does not readily translocate from older leaves to young leaves. Therefore, the deficiencies first appear on younger leaves.",Apply sulfur to the nursery seedbed by using fertilizers.; Incorporate straw into the soil instead of completely removing or burning it.; Improve soil management by carrying out dry tillage after harvesting to enhance sulfur uptake.,disease_images/Sulfur_Deficiency.jpg,400,300,JPEG,RGB

Fungal growth occurs in the bark during the winter when temperatures are above freezing but is stopped when trees resume growth in spring. Infection occurs mainly through mechanical injuries of the bark, cankers induced by other fungi and injuries to tissues by frost, sunburn or insect damage. High humidity (especially above 90%), rain and prolonged periods of leaf wetness increase the incidence and severity of the disease. Continuous wetting of the canker with irrigation water also promotes spore formation and liberation. However, low relative humidities impairs the life cycle of the fungus.

Two types of lesions are visible on older leaves: in mild cases, black specks and large eye-shaped lesions with light gray centers and darker margins. Severely infected leaves, in turn, are characterized by the presence of black specks and small brown spots with black margin and sometimes a chlorotic halo. Symptoms on the ear closely resemble and could easily be mistaken for Fusarium head blight.","To date, there is no evidence of biological control of M. oryzae in the field. However, in rice, seed treatment and foliar spray with formulations of Pseudomonas fluorescens effectively controls blast disease and increases the grain yield.",,"The symptoms are caused by the fungi Magnaporthe oryzae, which can survive on seeds and crop residues. Besides wheat, this species has diversified and adapted to infect important crops such as barley and rice as well as a number of other plants.

The aphids have long piercing mouth-parts which they use to suck the sap on shoot tips and young leaves, leading to distortions of twigs and the curling, rolling or folding of leaves. As they feed on the sweet plant phloem, they excrete the excess sugar as honeydew. When it falls onto leaves, it is readily colonized by sooty mold fungi that make the leaves turn black. This limits photosynthesis and has consequences on the vigor of the tree and the quality of the fruits. The damage to citrus trees can also be due to the infection of the tristeza virus, which is carried by the aphids.","Predators include many species of hoverflies, lacewings and ladybirds that can attack aphids at all stages of development. Two commonly used coccinellids against this pest are adults and larvae of Cycloneda sanguinea and Hippodamia convergens. Some culture-specific parasitic wasps may also be available for citrus in the area of interest. The fungus Neozygites fresensii can be an important check on aphid populations during humid weather. Ants can be killed with boiling water or with solutions containing natural pyrethrins. Insecticidal solutions can also be used against aphids, for example solutions based on soap, detergent soap, neem or chilli extracts.",,"Symptoms are caused by the adults and nymphs of the black citrus aphid Toxoptera aurantii.

In case of doubt, it may help to know, that contrarily to those, the planthopper will jumped when disturbed. Adults and nymphs have mouthparts that are adapted for piercing plant tissues and sucking the sap. Adults are often seen feeding gregariously, excreting the excess sugar as honeydew, which favors the growth of sooty mold. Dense populations of this insect may cause the stunting of new shoots and the weakening of the trees, either directly or through the growth of the opportunistic fungi. In other susceptible plant hosts, symptoms may be more dramatic, including chlorosis and necrosis of the leaves, withering of shoot tips and malformation and shriveling of seeds.","A parasitic wasp of the dryinid family, Psilodryinus typhlocybae, lay its eggs on the nymphs of Metcalfa pruinosa and can help to reduce populations.

Primary infection, which is caused by aphids, is visible mostly on younger leaves. The margins start to roll upwards and become dry, pale or develop interveinal chlorosis. In plants grown from a contaminated tuber (secondary infection), older leaves are upturned, stiff and brittle with a purple or red underside, while younger ones are upright and pale green or chlorotic. The plants growth is stunted and the stalks are stiff and point upwards. High infection levels reduce tuber yield and marketability.","Direct treatment of the virus is not possible, but reducing aphid population by means of predators or parasitoids is a helpful preventive measure. Ladybirds, soldier beetles, lacewings, and some types of midges and flies eat adults aphids and larvae.

In spring, the spores spread from juniper and infect nearby pear trees. The spots that emerge on the underside of the pear leaves are in fact spore-producing structures. These spores cannot reinfect pear leaves, so by the end of the summer, they are dispersed over long distances (up to 500 meters) to infect new junipers. There, it causes perennial horn-like swellings on the branches. These outgrowths are particularly conspicuous in spring, following periods of high humidity.","Carefully prune the fungal structures on the junipers.; Alternatively, remove nearby standing juniper trees.; Add plant fortifiers for the general strength of your pear trees.; Prune out any infected branch seen on pear, not single leaves.",disease_images/European_Pear_Rust.jpg,400,299,JPEG,RGB

Very small sunken spots of various colors appear on leaves, stems, flowers or fruits, often surrounded by a more or less marked yellow halo. On leaves, the spots later enlarge to form lesions and can cover a major part of the blades. They turn yellow and can shed prematurely leading to defoliation. 

Spots on fruits are brown to dark brown, first circular, then irregular as they expand. The fruit later softens and rot develops in the arils which turn dark gray or black but are not watery.

Anthracnose also can attack twigs and branches and results in cankers, which are areas of sunken, infected tissue with swollen edges.

Secondary infection is through the infected setts, irrigation water, splashed rains and soils. Infection usually occurs through the spindle along the edge of a partially expanded leaf. The spores that enter the spindle germinate and grow into the internal tissue of the spindle leaf. This results in the deformation and shortening of the leaves.

Iron Toxicity in Rice,Iron Toxicity,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/iron-toxicity-in-rice-rice-1.jpg,"Iron toxicity can happen throughout the growth cycle of the crop. It happens in lowland rice in various parts of the world. The enhanced absorption and excessive accumulation of iron in plant tissues lead to the production of toxic compounds. These cause the destruction of the chlorophyll and disrupt physiological processes, resulting in browning or bronzing leaves. High concentration of iron in the rhizosphere causes reduced root health and a lower absorption of important nutrients. This is associated with substantial yield losses (10-100%).",No biological control for this disorder is known.,,"Iron toxicity is due to an excess of iron in the root environment of the plant. This disorder is associated with flooded soils and affects primarily the production of lowland rice. Submerged soils both increase the concentration of iron and enhance its uptake by the plant.

Iron toxicity has been observed in flooded soils with a pH below 5.8 when aerobic (normal oxygen levels) and pH below 6.5 when anaerobic (low oxygen levels). Appropriate management practices include the liming of soils, improving soil fertility, and soil drainage at certain growth stages of the crop.

Citrus Red Mite,Panonychus citri,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/citrus-red-mite-citrus-1.jpg,"The damage is characterized by the appearance on young leaves at the periphery of the tree of tiny gray or silvery specks, a process called stippling. Occasionally, fruits and twigs may also be affected. At high levels of infestation, these specks merge into spots that give the leaf or the green fruit a silvery or bronze appearance. The damage to the leaf tissues reduce the area used for photosynthesis and attacked tissue gradually decay. Premature leaf fall, twig dieback, reduced quality of fruits and decreased vigor of the trees can ensue. This is particularly the case during adverse environmental conditions, for example dry, windy weather. By contrast, a good water supply reduces the incidence and the damage caused by this pest.","Panonychus citri has a large number of predators and other natural enemies, which is frequently sufficient to control its spread. Several phytoseiid mites (for example Euseius stipulatus) have been used in different countries for the effective control of the citrus red mite, when population numbers are still low.

Fungi, and particularly viruses, also play a major role in controlling Panonychus citri populations in the field, something that may be influenced by temperature.",,"Symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the adults and nymphs of the citrus red mite Panonychus citri.  They are characterized by a pear-shaped brick-red body and strong white hairs protruding from pearly spots on the back. They infect citrus trees and occasionally also other crops such as papaya, cassava or grapevine. It is found on both surfaces of leaves but appears mostly to feed on the upper surfaces. Thanks to the production of silk thread, it can be easily transported by wind to other trees. Insects and birds are other means of spreading. Infected tools and bad field practices can also propagate the pest to other fields. A good irrigation scheme with an optimal water supply for the trees reduces drastically the incidence and the damage caused by this pest.

Under favorable weather conditions, they become more numerous, enlarge and coalesce, turning dark brown or black in the process. Their center gradually becomes grayish and, in the later phases of the infection, it may show tiny dispersed black flecks. A reddish discoloration of the midrib of leaves is also common in some crops. In severe cases, the leaves wilt, dry and fall off, causing premature defoliation of the plant. On stems, lesions are elongated, sunken and brownish, also with darker margins. As they enlarge, the lesions may encircle the base of the stem, causing the plant to wilt and lodge. Top dieback of stems or branches is also common.","The spreading of the disease can be prevented by plunging seeds in a warm water bath before sowing (temperature and time depend on the crop). Neem oil can be sprayed. Biological agents might also help to control the infection.

There are two ways by which the infection is carried over to new plants. Primary infections happen when soil- or seed-borne spores infect seedling during emergence, growing systemically in the tissues. On other cases, the spores are splashed onto the lower leaves by rain drops and start an infection that spread upward. Secondary infections start when the spores produced within the leaf or fruit lesions are dispersed by rain splashes, dew, sucking insects or field workers to upper plant parts or to other plants.

It affects cultivated and wild species of barley and oat, as well as a number of grasses and, notably, the perennial weed commonly known as buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica). Mild to warm (20 to 25Â°C) sunny days and mild nights (15 to 20Â°C) with adequate moisture for dew formation are favorable for the fungus.",The sensible choice of resistant varieties is the best way to avoid the disease.,disease_images/Crown_Rust_of_Grasses.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB
Tomato Late Blight,Phytophthora infestans,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/tomato-late-blight-tomato-1556463954.jpg,"Brownish-green spots appear on the leaf margins and leaf tops. Later, large areas of the leaves turn brown completely. During wet weather, lesions on the lower side of the leaves may be covered with a gray to white moldy growth, making it easier to distinguish healthy from dead leaf tissue. As the disease progresses, the foliage runs brown, curls and dries. In some cases, the sharply delimited brown spots and the white covering also appear on the stems, branches, and petioles. Greyish-green to dirty-brown and wrinkled stains appear on the fruits. At these spots, the fruit flesh is hardened.","At this point, there is no biological control of known efficacy against late blight. To avoid spreading, remove and destroy plants around the infected spot immediately and do not compost infected plant material.",,The risk of infection is highest in midsummer. The fungus enters the plant via wounds and rips in the skin. Temperature and moisture are the most important environmental factors affecting the development of the disease.

The leaves can appear paler, stunted, with yellow edges or purplish veins on the lower side.",No biological treatment is known against this physiological disorder. It can only be treated with preventive measures.,,"The physiological disorder of leaf curling occurs due to environmental stress. Excessive moisture and high nitrogen levels are the main causes of leaf deformation, in addition to heat, dry conditions, severe pruning, root damage, and transplant shock. Leaf curling symptoms are also found and might be confused with viral infections.

The fungus easily penetrates through the wounds caused by routine trimming for example. Alternative hosts are limited to the family of nightshade, to which tomato belongs. The spots on the leaves contain the cushions that produce the spores. These are later transported through wind or rain splashes onto healthy plants. It is also thought that the disease can be transmitted via infected seeds. Didymella stem rot occurs over a wide range of conditions. However, cool temperatures (20Â°C), wet weather with splashing rain or the use of overhead irrigation are optimal.

Fertilizer Burn,Fertilizer Burn,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/fertilizer-burn-cotton-1.jpg,"Damage generally appears as browning of leaf edges or leaf scorch. Soluble salts from fertilizers can pull moisture out of the root tissues and cause wilting, marginal yellowing of leaves and stunting of the plants. Leaf burn or scorch can also result from direct foliar contact with some fertilizers.",There are no biological control options available for fertilizer burn.,,"Symptoms are caused by excessive fertilizer applications. Factors such as soil type, irrigation practices, salt levels, and the sensitivity of specific plants can influence the amount of damage. Damage to vegetable plants is more severe in hot dry weather. The salts contained in the fertilizer are more concentrated in the soil under drought conditions. This can lead to direct root injury, which will show up as leaf scorch in the aerial parts of the plant. Also, soluble salts may follow water movement through the plant and become concentrated in the leaves where moisture is lost rapidly on hot, dry days through transpiration or evaporation. In cool, cloudy weather, when there is adequate soil moisture, the rate of moisture loss from the leaves is slower, which allows many plants to tolerate high salt levels in the spring months, but not during the summer months.","Fertilizer burn problems can be prevented by selecting slow-release organic fertilizers.; The incorporation of a few centimeters of compost into the soil each year also helps.; Sweep granular fertilizers off foliage after spreading.; Use soluble foliar fertilizers according to label directions.; Do not to apply a granular fertilizer when the weather is extremely dry, and water thoroughly immediately after application to prevent plant burn.",disease_images/Fertilizer_Burn.jpg,400,711,JPEG,RGB

Over time, as the spots enlarge, the color of the infected leaf changes from yellowish (chlorosis) to brown (necrosis) and the leaf begins to curl and dry. The leaves will drop prematurely, leading to defoliation in severe cases. Occasionally, this pathogen causes disease on the blossoms or fruits with various symptoms.

They usually don't cause much damage, but if their numbers grow, they can become a problem. They create the foamy substance to protect from predators.  Spittlebugs have three parts to their life cycle: egg, immatute stage, adult. Each stage can last up to half a year.  When the eggs hatch, the young insects feed on the plant. During their following phase, they produce the foam to protect themself and keep growing until they become adults. In order to develop, the immature stage moves around the plant feeding on different parts of the plant for 1-3 months. Adult spittlebugs usually lay eggs in plant debris or in leaves and stems. Each female spittlebug lays around 100-200 eggs. They overwinter as eggs on plants. 
Immature stage is usually of green colour. Before developing into adults, the colour of the body darkens and wings start to develop. Spittlebugs prefer to feed on legumes and other nitrogen-fixing plants.","To get rid of spittlebugs, you can use a strong blast of water to wash away the foam and shake the bugs off the plant.; Clean up your field after the growing season ends to reduce overwintering eggs.; In the spring, check for any spittlebugs on weeds and get rid of them before the bugs can spread to your crops.",disease_images/Spittlebugs.jpg,400,711,JPEG,RGB

If infested during the vegetative state, they bore through the terminal buds of the shoots and move downward. This causes drying and shedding of terminal shoots before flowering. If the main stem is affected, the whole plant might collapse. When attacked in a later stage, the larvae will bore holes at the base of buds and bolls to feed inside. The tunnel entrance is often blocked by excrement. Damaged flower buds sometimes spread prematurely and so-called flared squares can be observed. Damage to the plant tissue can lead to fungal or bacterial infections.  The younger the plant, the more damage the spotted bollworm can cause.","Scouting for eggs or small larvae is essential in the management of this pest. Some parasitoid insects of the family Braconidae, Scelionidae and Trichogrammatidae can be used as a biological control method.

Bakanae can also be transmitted during farm operations, such as harvesting infected plants allowing fungal spores to spread to the healthy seeds, and soaking seeds in water that contains the fungus. High temperatures of 30 to 35Â°C favour the development of the disease.","Use clean seeds to minimize the occurrence of the disease.; Check the resistant varieties available.; Monitor your seedlings and avoid planting palish, albino plants.; Avoid over-fertilization with nitrogen-rich fertilizers.; Deep plowing of fields before planting helps to expose the soil to UV light.; Destroy the stubbles of the previous crop by plowing before sowing.",disease_images/Bakanae_and_Foot_Rot.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB

These factors alter the moisture in the plant tissues, leading initially to the wilting of young, tender leaves. These leaves gradually turn pale green and start to develop lesions near the apex and the margins after 2â3 days. The parched lesions later progress towards the middle of the leaf lamina. The defoliation caused by drought stress or insect attack can also lead to sunscalds to fruit or bark, since these are not shaded by the leaves anymore. In the bark they can take the form of cracks and cankers, which eventually develop into dead areas on the trunk.",White clay or talc formulations can be sprayed on foliage and trunk to physically block the sunlight. This may reduce temperatures by 5-10 Â°C. Products based on calcium carbonate or crystalline limestone are also recommended. Carnauba wax products serve as a natural sunscreen to plants.,,"Sunburn injury is common in plants or trees grown in areas with high solar radiation, high air temperatures, and low relative humidity. Altitude also plays a role since the ultraviolet (UV) radiation is greater at higher elevations. Symptoms are visible on leaves, fruits and bark. The incidence and severity of sunburn also depends on factors such as the variety of plant, its growth stage and soil moisture. Sunburn is particularly severe when air temperature and the number of sunny hours are high during the ripening period. The alternation of weather events is also important: thus, damage can also occur when cool or mild weather is abruptly followed by hot, sunny weather.",Use varieties that are more tolerant to sunburn.; Make sure that the irrigation is well-matched with the crop's water requirements.; Irrigate just before heat waves to avoid plant stress and sunburn.; Avoid excessive summer pruning and leaf stripping.; Improve air movement through the canopy.; Implement a plant or tree sprinkler cooling system.; Shade netting or fruit bagging can also be applied if needed.; Use cover crops between the rows to enhance soil water retention capacity (maize or pigeon pea in pineapple orchard for example).,disease_images/Sunburn.jpg,400,300,JPEG,RGB

Grapevine Phylloxera,Daktulosphaira vitifoliae,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/grapevine-phylloxera-grape-1663241502.jpg,"Daktulosphaira vitifoliae has two galling-producing stages; a leaf galling stage and a root galling stage. Small galls develop on the lower surface of the leaf. The size of the galls is about the size of half a pea. Sometimes, the entire leaf can be covered by galls. Leaf galling does not normally cause significant losses in grape production. However, severe infestations do cause considerable distortion and dropping of affected leaves late in the season. Leaf-galling forms of phylloxera are rarely present in some countries. Note that leaf inhabiting forms do not occur without the root form also present. 
On the other hand, the infestation of the roots can be difficult to control and can lead to root swelling and the decline of vines. Degradation of the root system can cause secondary fungal infections. Severe root infestations can cause defoliation and reduce shoot growth. Death of susceptible vines may result within 3 - 10 years. Usually, symptoms are less significant on vigorous vines over 10 years old.",Little information on the biological control of grape phylloxera is available; environmental and root conditions are more important than natural enemies.,,"The life cycle of Daktulosphaira vitifoliae is complex. This pest prefers heavy clay soils and dry conditions. In spring, the female hatches from a fertilized egg that had been laid on the wood of a grapevine, and migrate to a leaf where she produces a gall. Within 15 days, the female reaches maturity, fills the gall with eggs and dies soon afterwards. Nymphs that hatch from these eggs escape from the gall, and wander to new leaves. They produce new galls and eggs. During summer, there may be 6 or 7 generations. In the fall, nymphs migrate to the roots where they hibernate through the winter. The following spring they become active again and produce the root galls. Wingless females may cycle indefinitely on the roots year after year. In late summer and fall, some of the roots inhabiting phylloxera lay eggs that develop into winged females. Winged females migrate from the roots to the stems where they lay eggs of two sizes, the smaller ones developing into males and the larger ones into females. Mating occurs and the female then lays a single fertilized egg that overwinters on the grape stem. It is this egg that gives rise to leaf inhabiting generations. Depending on geographical factors, generations with different life cycles may develop at the same time.","Resistant rootstocks (American rootstocks) have been the main and most successful control measure for many decades.; All Vitis vinifera varieties and French hybrid cultivars are susceptible to injury from the root gall insect and it is.; In general, rootstocks with no vinifera parentage have retained their resistance remarkably.; In the past, flooding vineyards for several weeks was classically used.",disease_images/Grapevine_Phylloxera.jpg,400,533,JPEG,RGB

Females insert their mouthparts into the tree and never move again, whilst eating and reproducing in the same spot. Their armor is shaped like an oyster shell, and is brownish purple to black, with a grey border. Male armored scales are also immobile until maturity. Immature male scale armor is white with parallel sides and three longitudinal sections, one central and two marginal ridges. U. citri secrete a protective coating composed of wax and cast skins of prior instars, which creates its armor. The armor will remain on fruit long after the insect is dead, disfiguring the fruit.","Clean farming equipment before moving to new groves.; Brush your clothing before entering a new area of a grove.; Nymphs can be moved by wind, farming equipment and workers in the field.; As the Citrus Snow Scale nymph is the mobile life stage, preventing the distribution of this stage is crucial.",disease_images/Citrus_Snow_Scale.jpg,400,533,JPEG,RGB

To confirm the presence of termites, it is necessary to pull out the affected plants and examine the roots and lower stem for live insects or the presence of tunnels. Plant roots and stems may be completely hollowed out and filled with soil waste. Some plants lodge during strong wind and they are often covered with soil, under which termites may be found. It is important to examine plants in the early morning or late evening, as termites may have moved deeper into the soil during the day when temperatures are higher.",Preparations based on nematodes that attack termites are effective against this pest. Solutions containing the fungi Beauveria bassiana or some species of Metarhizium are effective when applied into the termite hill. Fungi spores can also act as repellents.

Another solution is to pour wood ash or pounded Neem leaves or seeds into the holes dig by the termites in order to repel termites.,,"Termites live in large colonies consisting of many workers, soldiers and reproductive forms. Their nests are sometimes very elaborate. Some build nests on moist dead tree stumps, while others build subterranean nests. They feed away from the nest protected through underground tunnels, on plant roots and other material in fields. Termites may attack plants if there is no other food available, therefore ensure there is plenty of soil organic matter. The reproductive termites are winged. Numerous winged males and females, generally dark in color and with well-developed eyes, are produced for swarming. Swarming is often taking place at dusk after the onset of heavy rains.

From late summer onwards, flat or bracket-shaped fungi develop on the bark of dead branches. They have a whitish woolly upper surface and a purple-brown lower surface. Both sides have  spore-forming bodies and are soft and slippery when wet, brittle and shriveled when dry.","In many cases, the trees will recover naturally from an attack of silver leaf, so it is recommended to wait some time before taking action.",,"The symptoms are caused by the fungus Chondrostereum purpureum, which build conspicuous fruiting bodies on the trunks and dead branches. These structures yield spores that are later released and transported by the wind to healthy trees and shrubs. They enter the tissues through wounds, mainly caused by pruning. As they grow down into the wood, they slowly kill it, producing a characteristic dark stain of the internal tissues. They also secrete a toxin that is carried up to the leaves through the sap stream. This toxin damages tissues and causes them to separate, conferring them the silvery aspect. So, even though the fungus is not actually present in the leaves, it can kill the leaves and branches. New fruiting bodies later appear on the dead wood and the cycle starts again. Drizzly, rainy, foggy or humid days with no wind or sun provide the perfect conditions for spore release and infection.","Only work with clean, disinfected tools.; Protect trees from unnecessary injuries.; Monitor the orchard regularly.; Routine pruning in late spring or summer avoids the main infection phase.; Avoid pruning during wet weather conditions, which favor infection.; Cover wounds with wound dressing to avoid the germination of spores.; Dispose of the pruned material (burning or burying) immediately, as fruiting bodies form continuously.; Make sure to exclude alternative hosts like willows and poplars from and around the orchard.",disease_images/Silver_Leaf.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB

Trees may experience defoliation and in severe cases twig death. Blooms may also fail, resulting in significant reductions in crop production.",Spray the foliage of trees with organic copper compounds such as Bordeaux mixture after the fruit has been harvested in fall and again in late winter in case of frequent fall rains.,,"The symptoms are caused by the fungus Fusicladium oleagineum, which thrives in low-lying areas or in environments that receive little sunlight or have a closed tree canopy. It requires  mild to low temperatures and free moisture on the leaves to germinate and so it usually leads to infections during rainy periods in fall, winter, and spring. Fog, dew, and high humidity are important factors contributing to the spread of the disease. By contrast, hot and dry conditions in the summer cause the inactivation of the fungus that eventually can go dormant. This is denoted by the change of color of the spots, which turn white and crusted. Young leaves are more susceptible to infection than older ones. The preferred temperature range is 14â24 Â°C, however it can persist between 2â27 Â°C. Nutrient deficiencies or imbalances in the soil may also increase the susceptibility of the trees.

Affected leaf sheaths may have abundant whitish powdery fungal growth visible on the outer surface. Grains of emerged panicles become discolored and sterile. Un-emerged panicles produce florets that turn red-brown to dark brown. Infection is most damaging when it occurs at late booting stages and can cause severe damage.","Bacteria such Rhizobacteria of Pseudomonas fluorescens isolated from citrus and rice are toxic to the rice sheath rot fungus, resulting in lesser incidence and more yield.

This causes a pale stippling and bleaching on the upper leaf surface that can become very obvious by mid to late summer. While they feed, they foul the underside of leaves with specks of dark excrement, that sometimes drips onto pavement and other surfaces beneath infested trees. A prolonged exposure of almond trees to high populations of poplar lace bugs may cause premature leaf drop (or defoliation) and a reduction in plant growth. The symptoms caused by this pest are not unique. Certain other true bugs and thrips also produce leaf stippling and dark excrement. Mite infestations do show stippling but not dark excrement, and rather display mite cast skins and fine silken webbing. Examining trees with a magnifying glass can help identify the cause of the symptoms.","In orchards with a history of infestation with this pest, inspect plants about once a week beginning of late winter. Take action when lace bug nymphs become abundant and before damage becomes extensive. A forceful stream of water directed at the underside of leaves early in the season, when nymphs are the predominant life stage, and repeated at intervals, can help to suppress populations on young trees. Treatments with insecticidal soap, narrow-range oil, neem oil, and natural pyrethrins could also be envisaged.",,"The symptoms are caused by the poplar lace bug Monosteira unicostata. Adults are about 3 mm long and have  forewings with numerous, semitransparent cells that give the body a lace-like appearance. They can overwinter as eggs in leaves on evergreen hosts or as adults in protected locations, such as under bark plates and fallen leaves or other debris beneath the trees. With the arrival of the spring they emerge and recover their activity, settling on the leaves. Female insert tiny, oblong eggs, in isolation or in groups, close to the main veins on the underside of leaves and cover them with dark excrement. Nymphs appear at 10-18 days, forming colonies and feeding gregariously by piercing and sucking the leaf sap. They reach adulthood after about 10 days, passing through five nymphal states. All life stages can be present throughout the year on evergreen hosts in areas with mild winters. Lace bugs develop through egg, nymph, and adult life stage, and have several generations a year.","Monitor the orchard regularly for symptoms of the pest.; If infection does not involve defoliation and does not seriously harm the trees, it could be wise to tolerate them because the injury is mostly aesthetic.; Apply balanced fertilization and irrigation to increase the almond trees' natural resistance against sucking insects.; Do not use broad-scale insecticides which may kill all kinds of predatory insects of lace bugs.; Increase the abundance of natural enemy by growing a variety of flowering plant species.; Prune infected tree parts and destroy the debris.",disease_images/Poplar_Lace_bug.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB

The disease is characterized by two types of symptoms: seedling blight and head blight. In the former, light-brown, water-soaked lesions appear at the base of the stem and the seedling turn necrotic during emergence. This is particularly striking when infected seeds are sown in cool, moist soil. During later stages of plant development, crown and basal stem rot are commonly observed. Water-soaked spikelets and a bleached straw color are two distinctive signs of head blight. During warm, humid weather, the they take a pink to light-brown cast, due to the abundant fungal growth. The kernels have a shriveled and rough appearance. Usually, the infection spread from spikelet to spikelet until the entire spike is affected. In some crops, yield losses have been evaluated to up to 70%.","Several biocontrol agents have been tested successfully to reduce the effects of the infection by Fusarium graminearum. In wheat, different products containing the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus megatherium and Bacillus subtilis have been applied during flowering time to reduce the incidence of the disease, its  severity and yield losses. Most of these trial were done in filed-controlled condition. Competitive fungi Trichoderma harzianum and Clonostachys rosea have also been used with some success. A dry heat treatment of 70 Â°C for 5 days was found to be an effective method to rid the seeds from this fungus, as well as others, from wheat and barley seeds.",,"The symptoms of head blight of cereals are caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum, which survives in-between seasons in alternative hosts or in a latent state on crop debris and organic matter on the soil. Under favorable conditions, it starts to produce spores that may be transported by air currents over long distances. It is also thought that its spread could be facilitated by some species of midges. The susceptibility of cereals to this fungus is at its highest around the flowering period. Once it germinates on the plant tissue, it is able to penetrate the cuticle directly through natural pores. As it grows in the vascular tissues, it hinders the supply of water and nutrients in the spikes, resulting in the typically bleached spikelets and the shriveled kernels. Moreover, the production of toxins reduces the marketability of the grain. A range of environmental factors such as light intensity, temperatures, humidity, precipitations and leaf wetness can influence its life cycle. Temperatures between 20-32Â°C and prolonged leaf wetness are highly favorable.","Use resistant varieties, if available.; Choose locations that are exposed to the sun and with good aeration.; Increase crop spacing at sowing to allow for a good ventilation of the crop.; Plan a crop rotation with non-host species.; Avoid excessive fertilization with nitrogen.; Check the necessity of tillage as this can favor the life cycle of the fungus.; Clear the field and surrounding from weeds and alternative hosts.; Remove plant residues after harvest and bury them.",disease_images/Fusarium_Head_Blight.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB

Infected seeds can be discoloured and look purplish brown.",Cultivate resistant varieties.,,"Damage is caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella pinodes, Phoma medicaginis var. pinodella which may either be seed-borne, soil-borne or survive in pea trash. The disease usually becomes established when fungal spores, produced and stored on old pea stubble, are carried into the new crop by the wind. Infection may occur at any stage of plant growth. Spores produced on infected plants are transferred onto adjacent healthy plants by wind and rain splash. The disease can also become established by the sowing of infected seeds. During wet weather, the disease may spread rapidly. In a dry year, the planting of infected seeds may not produce a diseased crop, but under wet conditions severe disease is likely. The fungi can survive in the soil for several years.","Practice clean cultivation.; When planting, aim for the separation of at least 500 m from last yearâs pea paddock.; Avoid using old or damaged seeds that can reduce seedling vigour and increase susceptibility to infection.; Avoid early sowing at high seeding rates as this increases the exposure of pea seedlings to the pathogens and produces crops with a large canopy, increased lodging and high humidity; all of which increase the risk of developing the disease.; Practice crop rotation whenever possible.; Peas should not be grown in the same paddock more than once in 3 years.; If the disease occurs, the rotation should be extended to 1 in 4 or 5 years.; Destroy infected pea trash and self-sown plants by grazing and burning.",disease_images/Blackspot_of_Field_Pea.jpg,400,533,JPEG,RGB

These small gray-colored flies are polyphagous and attack main crops such as wheat, maize and sorghum. Other plants, such as peppers, beans or lentils, can also be affected. Females lay eggs singly, or more rarely in pairs, on the stems or on the soil near the base of the seedlings (the 3-4-leaf stage is preferred). The application of farmyard manure to the soil seems to attract more female flies and increase ovoposition. Newly emerged larvae are cylindrical and white.

Banana Moth,Opogona sacchari,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/banana-moth-banana-1563276168.jpg,"The infestation can occur during the vegetative growing stage, the flowering stage and also after harvesting. Typically, the adult moths are attracted to damaged and stressed plants. Feeding damage is only due to the larvae, which normally feed on rotting plant material. Having eaten up the residues, they start to feed on the healthy plant material (roots, stems, pseudostems, stalks and fruits). Seeds can be attacked, too. Initial symptoms appear as tunnels, but it is very difficult to spot them in the early stages. Most commonly, the pest is detected at later stages. The fleshy plant parts can be entirely hollowed out and leaves appear wilted. In adverse conditions this might result in defoliation and collapse of the plant.","In greenhouse experiments, the use of nematodes such as Steinernema feltiae, Heterorhabditis bacterophora and Heterorhabditis heliothidis was effective against the larvae. Also bacillus thuringiensis products can be used.",,"The symptoms are caused by the larvae of the species Opogona sacchari. The moths are nocturnal. They have a bright brown body, are about 11 mm in size and have a wing span of 18-25 mm. Forewings are of an homogeneous brown, with sometimes a long darker banding and males have a dark brown spot on them. The back wings are gray and brighter, with fringes in the margins. The female moth lays around 50-200 eggs in groups of about 5 into wounds and cracks of the plant tissue. After about 12 days the white or pale green, slightly transparent larvae hatch. The larvae have a bright reddish to brown head with an eye-like mark on both sides. The larvae grow to about 26 mm within about 50 days. Then they pupate at the end of the feeding tunnels.

On leaves, angular necrotic spots become visible, limited by smaller veins, and irregularly distributed on the lamina. These spots are often surrounded with a chlorotic halo. These spots begin as distinguishable moist, brown lesions normally restricted to the bottom of the plant until they enlarge and coalesce, thereby often killing the entire leaf. Pools of gum exudate along wounds and leaf cross veins. This process begins with a sappy golden liquid which subsequently hardens to form an amber colored deposit. Young stems and petioles may crack after infestation, also oozing gum.","Soaking of infested seeds in hot water at 60Â°C for 20 min, followed by drying in shallow layers at 30Â°C overnight or at 50Â°C for 4 h, reduces the number of bacteria significantly. Seeds can also be immersed in water and heated in a microwave oven until the water temperature reaches 73Â°C followed by immediate disposal of the water.",,"The symptoms are caused by a strain of the bacterium Xanthomonas axonopodis that readily infects cassava plants (manihotis). Within the crop (or fields), the bacteria are dispersed by wind or rain splashes. Contaminated tools are also an important means of spread, as well as movement of man and animals through plantations, especially during or after rain. However, the main problem with this pathogen is its distribution over large distances in apparently symptomless planting material, cuttings and seeds, particularly in Africa and Asia. The infection process and the development of the disease requires 12 hours of 90-100% relative humidity with optimal temperatures of 22-30 Â°C.

Banana Scab Moth,Nacoleia octasema,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/banana-scab-moth-1.jpg,"The damage from the banana scab moths is primarily caused by the larval stage and principally confined to the fruits. The larvae concentrate their attack on fruit bunches still protected by bracts. At emergence, they start feeding on the inflorescences and the surface of the developing fruits, damaging them superficially and resulting in scars which quickly turn black. Over time, as the bract begin to lift and fall, they migrate down the bunch to younger and still shielded fruits. If they have no alternative, the larvae remain at the base of the bunch, feeding on male inflorescences, or on maturing fruits. Often a clear jelly-like substance, which appears to be associated only with banana scab moth feeding, is present at these sites. The cosmetic scabbing of the fruit cause makes them unsuitable for market.","No major parasite or predator have been identified against this pest. Some wasp parasites, spiders and other general predators provide a low level of natural control. The ant Tetramorium bicarinatum which is commonly found on plants and bunches can give some control of the banana scab moth.

Adults are light brown of yellowish-brown with black marks on wings. These short-lived moth (4-5 days)  have twilight-active habits and mates in the early evening. During the day, they hide in trash and under old leaf axils. Females lay eggs on the emerging bunches or the surrounding leaves and bracts. After hatching, the larvae make their way to the bunch and commence feeding. The life cycle from egg-hatching to egg-laying is completed in 28 days. The banana scab moth favors moist and warm conditions, causing the worst damage during the wet season. The cooler and drier winter months are usually free of this insect, unless unseasonal rainfall occurs during this period.

Below ground symptoms include the development of knotted swellings on the roots and a loss of the smaller roots (also called root hairs). Over time, the swellings lead to a severe distortion, ending up in club-shaped aspect of the roots instead of the normal fine network (thereby the common name of the disease). Growth and yield are severely reduced and very badly affected plants may die.",The only organic control available is to raise the pH of the soil to a more alkaline 7.2 by mixing oyster shell or dolomite lime into the soil in the fall (small gardeners and farmers).

It is an obligate parasite that affects, among other plants, a series of important crops, such as Brussels sprouts, cabbages, cauliflowers, turnips, and radishes. The strategy of the fungus is to produce dormant spores that can contaminate soil for up to 20 years. In the presence of susceptible plant roots, these spores germinate and infect the root hairs, causing the swellings in the roots that give the disease its name. These swellings then produce more spores that are released to the soil, completing the cycle. The disease is favored by moist and warm soils.

Older plants show symptoms of wilt first and gradually dry up. They are more likely to survive but will have poor vigor and stunted growth. The affected stems can easily lodge when strong winds blow or due to a heavy boll load. Further symptoms are reduced number of bolls and poor quality of the fibers.,"Application of Neem cake to the soil mixed with farmyard manure (FYM) during the basal fertilization can reduce the chance of stem and shoot weevil infestations (10 tons FYM + 250 kg of Neem cake/ha). Furthermore, young plants can be drenched with a Neem oil solution to prevent adult weevils from laying eggs onto leaves. Pheromone traps can be used for weevil monitoring and control (combined with an bio-insecticide)",,"Damage is caused by the cotton stem weevil, Pempherulus affinis. Adult weevils are small, dark brown in color, with white tones on their wing covers and head. Females lay their eggs in the growing shoots of young plants. After hatching, the white grubs burrow into the stem between the bark and stem, and start feeding on the vascular tissues. This causes the typical swellings on the stem just above the ground level. The cotton shoot weevil (Alcidodes affaber) behaves in a very similar way. Therefore, the same treatment and prevention measures can be applied. However, cotton shoot weevils are dark grayish brown with pale bands on their forewings. Cotton stem weevil can occasionally be a  serious pest in some parts of South India, particularly Tamil Nadu.","Use dense spacing between plants to hinder the insect.; Earth up along the rows of seedlings to hinder the weevil.; Reduce cropping intensity, e.g.; by planning a fallow or a crop rotation.; Remove alternate hosts in and around the field (hibiscus, Indian mallow).; Monitor fields and remove affected plants.; Remove and burn plant residues after the harvest.; Use pheromone traps to monitor the presence of the weevil.",disease_images/Cotton_Stem_Weevil.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB

Other bacteria (Bacillus circulans and Serratia marcescens) have been used to control other species of Mycosphaerella and reduce the incidence of related diseases in other crops. Spray of 3 gm wettable sulphur per one litre of water or dusting of 8-10 kg of sulphur powder per hectare are other possibilities.,,"The symptoms are caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella areola, which survives on plant debris or volunteer plants from previous seasons. These are the main sources of inoculum in the new season. Temperatures between 20-30 Â°C, wet and humid conditions (80% or more) and intermittent rainfalls promote the infection and the progression of the disease. Cool weather coupled with prolonged dewy nights for several days in a row, even in the absence of rain, also favor the fungus. The spores are produced in leaf lesions and are subsequently transported by the wind to healthy plants, resulting in secondary infections. Plants are more vulnerable during the late part of the season, just before or during boll set.","Plant resistant varieties, (several are available ).; Plant on raised ridges to improve drainage.; Do not sow to early or too late during the season.; Space plants to allow canopy to dry quickly after rainfall.; Regularly observe the cotton field for symptoms of the disease.; Remove leaves displaying symptoms and destroy them.; Control susceptible weeds in and around the field.; Destroy volunteer crops from previous seasons.; Use a drip irrigation system and avoid overhead irrigation to minimize leaf wetness.; Water plants in the morning so plants dry during the day.; Avoid frequent irrigation to maintain a drier canopy and soil surface.; Avoid excessive application of nitrogenous fertilizers or manures.; Do not work in the field when plants are wet.; Remove plant residues and burn them at a distance of the cotton field.; Implement 2- or 3-year crop rotation with non-hosts, for example cereals.",disease_images/Grey_Mildew_of_Cotton.jpg,400,300,JPEG,RGB
Red Pumpkin Beetle,Aulacophora foveicollis,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/red-pumpkin-beetle-melon-1687167099.jpg,"The adult insects feed voraciously on the leaves, flowers and fruits. The beetle produces large holes in the plant tissues (between the veins), causing growth retardation and eventually death of the plant. The damage done to young seedlings is often devastating as it delays crop maturity. If flowers are affected, it will result in reduced fruit setting. The grubs of this pest remain in the soil and feed on roots and underground stem of the plants, which causes rotting and withering of the stems and roots. Adults feeding on seedlings may retard the development and even lead to death, thus resulting in bare patches in the field. Beetles sometimes aggregate and gnaw on the foliage of older plants. Flower parts can also suffer some damage, resulting in reduced fruit setting.
Lower parts of young fruits show scars caused by adult feeding, enabling the invasion by rot causing micro-organisms.","Natural enemies attack the beetle, including members of the tachinid family and the reduviid Rhynocoris fuscipes. Mix half a cup of wood ash and half a cup of lime in 4 litres of water, and leave to stand for a few hours. Strain and test this mixture on a few infested plants before applying on your field. Apply the mixture as a foliar spray on your crop. Alternatively, you can use plant-derived products such as neem (NSKE 5%), derris or pyrethrum (add soap with it) @ 7-day interval.

They insert their piercing and sucking mouthparts into individual cells and extract the content, among other the green chlorophyll. On leaves, the feeding activity appear to the naked eye as minute yellowish spots on the lamina. Heavily infection leads to mottled leaves with poor growth that can subsequently die and shed. The attack of the terminal shoots results in a characteristic 'candle stick' symptom, referring to the necrotic aspect and shedding of shoot tips. Cassava plants aged 2-9 months are the most vulnerable to infestation. Severe mite attack can result in 20-80 % loss in tuber yield. Moreover, the quality of the cassava stems is also compromised, often resulting in a shortage of planting materials for perpetuation of the crop.","Several predator species are reported to effectively reduce mite populations. Introduction of Amblyseius limonicus and A. idaeus reduced green spider mite infestation by 50%. The predatory mites Typhlodromalus aripo and T. manihoti have been established in several countries in Africa, successfully controlling populations of the cassava green spider mite. Parasitic fungi of the genus Neozygites also showed good results in several countries, causing mortalities in cassava green spider mites. Sprays containing neem oil compounds can also show satisfying results.",,"The symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the green spider mites Mononychellus tanajoa and Mononychellus progresivus. They feed on the underside of young leaves by inserting their piercing and sucking mouth parts into individual cells and extracting the cell contents. They are considered minor pests of cassava but under favorable conditions, for example during the dry season, they can cause significant damage. The mite can actively move from one plant to another, but may also be dispersed by wind and water splashes. As they can survive up to 60 days on cuttings, the main vector of the mites are often the farmers themselves, who transport infested plant material between fields or farms. Young mites are green in color, later turning yellowish as adults. They are recognizable by their inconspicuous body segmentation that gives the appearance of a single body unit. Adult females are bigger than the males and can reach a size of 0.8 mm.","Use varieties with good tolerance to the mite.; Only use certified cuttings for planting.; Plant early at the start of the rainy season, to ensure sufficient plant resistance when the dry season begins.; Intercrop with pigeon pea, if possible in double or triple rows, and avoid slanted planting.; Regularly monitor the manioc field for symptoms or sightings of the mite.; Avoid transportation of infested material to markets or other fields as this is the main cause of dispersal.",disease_images/Cassava_Green_Spider_Mite.jpg,400,711,JPEG,RGB

There are three subgroups of bacteria that vary in the severity of the symptoms they cause to their hosts. They are spread naturally within the field nurseries by wind-blown rain, dropping dew or overhead irrigation. They can also be transmitted mechanically from tree to tree under normal field or nursery work, mainly when foliage is wet. The natural pores on leaves or the lenticels on bark are the entry points for the bacteria. However, the bacterium dies when the young trees are transplanted into groves, and symptoms gradually disappear. Warm temperatures (14 to 38 Â°C) with light rains, heavy dews, and windy weather are most conducive for disease development and spread. By contrast, the growth of the bacterium and the infection process is impaired when the weather is hot and dry.","Use healthy planting material from a certified source.; Select varieties with some degree of resistance to the disease.; Avoid low-lying or shaded sites with poor air circulation and soil drainage.; Prune trees to allow for a better air circulation and to maintain tree vigor.; Ensure a good vitality in young plantations.; Use artificial or natural windbreaks with fast-growing trees to reduce tissue damages by blowing soil particles due to strong winds.; Do not work in the orchards or prune when foliage is wet with rain or dew.; Remove infected shoots by pruning a few centimeters below the symptoms on the bark.; Control pests that could damage the leaves and promote the infection, such as leaf miners.; Disinfect equipments and tools after field work.; Check for possible quarantine regulations in your country.",disease_images/Bacterial_Spot_of_Citrus.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB

Leaf Reddening of Cotton,Leaf Reddening,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/leaf-reddening-of-cotton-cotton-1.jpg,"The actual reddening of the leaves can vary slightly depending on the cause and the crop stage. In most cases, leaf margins turn red first and the discoloration later spreads to the rest of the blade. Other symptoms may include wilting, reddening of stems, poor or no boll development, leaf and fruit shed and stunted plants. During senescence, the discoloration is a natural process that can usually be observed throughout the whole field. Besides nitrogen deficiencies, leaf reddening can also be caused by overexposure to direct sunlight, cold temperatures and wind damage. In that case, the discoloration affects single leaves rather than the whole field.","Depending on stress and growth stage, the application of organic fertilizers can be beneficial for the plant. Biological control is not necessary if the leaf reddening starts late in the season or if the process is triggered by physical factors.",,"Symptoms can be caused by several abiotic factors such as water, continuous temperature stress or soil poor fertility. Some varieties or hybrids are more susceptible than others. The reddening is due to the increase in a red pigment called anthocyanin and a decrease in the green pigment chlorophyll in leaves. A cause can be the death of rootlets that reduces the ability of the plant to actively take up water and nutrients. During senescence, this process is natural and has no negative effect on the yield. Other causes early in the season may be the deficiency of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (magnesium does not seem to be involved). Furthermore, overexposure to sunlight, wind and cold temperatures can also trigger discoloration.",Plant at the recommended time to avoid high soil temperatures during fruiting.; Check the best distance between plants.; Use cotton varieties resistant to abiotic stress.; Make sure to have an adequate manuring of the soil.; Protect the crops from physiological stress like direct wind damage.; Plan a judicious irrigation according to the plant's needs.; Monitor soil nutrients and apply balanced nutrient management practices.; After harvest plow deep to mix soil.,disease_images/Leaf_Reddening_of_Cotton.jpg,400,223,JPEG,RGB

The rapid development of the wilting is characteristic, a feature that can be used to differentiate root rot from other pathologies causing this symptom. In the beginning, only a few plants in the field are affected, but over time, the disease spreads in a circular manner around these plants throughout the field. The wilting taking place above ground is actually a late manifestation of the disease, a sign of the rotting of the roots and the poor transport of water and nutrients to the aerial parts of the plant. Eventually, the affected plants lose stability and are easily dislodged by wind or can easily be pulled out of the ground. The bark of roots takes a yellowish appearance compared to healthy plants and is often broken into shards.","To this day, no biological agent is known to provide efficient control against cotton root rot.

Initially small yellow-green lesions appear on young leaves for bacterial spot, whilst bacterial speck causes black spots with a narrow yellow halo. They are usually more numerous on leaf margins or tips, which may appear deformed and twisted. In severe cases, the spots of bacterial speck may coalesce or overlap, resulting in larger and irregular lesions. Bacterial spot lesions can enlarge from 0.25 cm to 0.5 cm and become tan to brownish-red, which will eventually look like shot holes when the center dries up. Bacterial spot produces similar lesion of fruits as it does on the leaves and eventually roughen, becoming brown and scabbed. Bacterial speck causes tiny, slightly raised black specks. It is difficult to distinguish between these two diseases at an early stage.","Bacterial Spot is very difficult to control and also expensive to treat. If the disease occurs early in the season, consider destroying the entire crop. Copper-containing bactericides provide a protective cover on foliage and fruit for both bacteria.

Submerging seeds for one minute in sodium hypochlorite or in hot water (50Â°C) for 25 minutes can reduce the incidence of both diseases.",,"Bacterial Spot and Speck are caused by several species of bacteria of the genus Xanthomonas, and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. Bacterial spot occurs worldwide and is one of the most devastating diseases on tomatoes grown in warm, moist environments. The pathogens can survive in or on seeds, plant debris, and specific weeds. Xanthomonas has a limited survival period of days to weeks in the soil. Secondary infection can occur through rain or overhead irrigation. It enters the plant tissues through leaf pores and wounds. Optimal temperatures range from 25 to 30Â°C for the bacterial spot. Once the crop is infected, the disease is very difficult to control and can lead to total crop losses.

Manual removal of damaged leaves is the best practice to follow.,,"The damage to mango trees is caused by a pest called the Mango Leaf Twisting Weevil. This pest exists in both the nursery and the main field. It also affects other plants like Jamun, Amaranthus, Jack Fruit, Cashew, Teak, Guava, and Neem. Recently, it has been observed in Almond trees as well, in the year 2023. The life cycle of this pest includes different stages: eggs, five larval instars in the grub stage, pupa, and adult. The adult lays eggs one by one in the outer part of the twisted leaves. The female weevil secretes a sticky substance that helps the eggs stick to the leaf surface. The eggs have a shiny yellow color. The grub, which is the young and immature form of the weevil, is yellowish in color. It feeds on the tissue inside the rolled leaves, causing damage to the affected leaves. The adult weevil is reddish brown and has a long snout. It cuts and twists the mango leaves into rolls. These rolled leaves stay attached to the main leaves.

Early damage on young fruits develops into deep cleft on the skin by the time they have reached full size in late summer.","In autumn, endangered trees can be equipped with a glue ring, which is attached firmly to the trunk, using supporting stakes if necessary. This stops the females on their journey from the soil to the crown. Eggs laid above the glue ring  have to be removed with a brush. Products based on Bacillus thuringiensis can also be applied to ward off the caterpillars. Applications containing neem extracts (Azadirachta indica) are also effective. Spinosad formulations can be sprayed when leaves are fully expanded, targeting the larvae. Spinosad can be harmful to bees and should not be used at full bloom.",,"Damage is caused by he caterpillars of the winter moth, Operophtera brumata. After mating, the female deposits overwintering eggs on the bark, in bark crevices or under bark scales. These eggs hatch when temperatures average around 12-13ÂºC. The newly hatched caterpillars migrate up the tree trunks and wriggle between the scales of newly emerging buds. They cannot bore through closed bud scales, but as these open, they can scrape away at the soft leaf tissue below. Wet summers, and mild and moist autumns favor the life cycle of this pest. Mature caterpillars drop to the soil for pupation. Host plants include apricot, cherry, apple, plum, currant and some forest trees.",Regularly monitor the orchard for signs of the pathogen.; Avoid planting susceptible plants near the orchard.; Remove weeds as they can serve as alternative hosts.; Remove tree debris as soon as possible and destroy them at a distance of the orchard by burying them deep or burning them.; Plow the field after harvest to expose the pupae to predators and cold temperatures.; Use glue rings on trunks to hinder females on their journey from the soil to the crown.,disease_images/Winter_Moth.jpg,400,711,JPEG,RGB
Green Paddy Leafhoppers,Nephotettix spp.,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/green-paddy-leafhoppers-1.jpg,"Green leafhoppers are the most common leafhoppers in rice fields and transmit the viral disease tungro. The virus leads to leaf tip discoloration, reduced number of tillers, stunted plants with reduced vigor, and in worst cases plant withering. In order to tell the symptoms of tungro-infected crops from nitrogen deficiency or iron toxicity, check for the presence of the insect: white or pale yellow eggs inside leaf sheaths or midribs; yellow or pale green nymphs with or without black markings; pale green adults with or without black markings and with a characteristic diagonal movement.","Biological control includes small wasps (parasitize the eggs), mirid bug; strepsipterans, pipunculid flies, and nematodes (parasitize both the nymphs and adults), aquatic veliid bugs, nabid bugs, empid flies, damselflies, dragonflies, and spiders or fungal pathogens.",,"Green leafhoppers are common in rainfed and irrigated wetland environments. They are not prevalent in upland rice. Both the nymphs and adults feed on the dorsal surface of the lateral leaf blades rather than the leaf sheaths and the middle leaves. They also prefer rice plants that have been fertilized with large amount of nitrogen. It is usually not a pest of concern, except while transmitting RTV.","Use insect resistant and tungro resistant varieties (ex: CR-1009).; Reduce the number of rice crops to two per year.; Synchronize crop establishment across farms.; Plant early within a given planting period, particularly in the dry season.; Perform crop rotation with a non-rice crop during the dry season.; Light traps can be used to show or reduce numbers.; Apply nitrogen as recommended.; Control weeds in the field and on the field margins to decrease alternate hosts.",disease_images/Green_Paddy_Leafhoppers.jpg,400,266,JPEG,RGB
Castor Semilooper,Achaea janata,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/castor-semilooper-1556091254.jpg,The smooth grayish-brown caterpillars inflict damage to crops that can range from skeletonization of leaves (with only main veins left) to complete defoliation of the plant or devastation of the field. The young larvae nibble the epidermis of the leaves while the older larvae are voracious feeders that can eat up the whole plant and cause considerable damage.,"The application of a mixture of neem seed kernel extract at 5% and neem oil at 2% reduces populations if synchronized with early larval stage. Wasps of the species Trichogramma evanescens minutum parasitize the eggs. The larvae, in turn, are heavily parasitized by the braconid parasites, Microplitis maculipennis and species of the genus Rhogas. Other parasites are also commercially available or under trial research. Some species of birds are also effective predators of late larval stages. Providing bird perches helps in reducing the incidence of the pest.",,"The feeding is caused by larvae of Ophiusa melicerta. Adult moths are light brown with scales over the whole body, that resemble a hang-glider. They have characteristic black and white patterns in the posterior region of the hindwings. Females lay eggs in clusters on the leaf surface and the tender parts of the plants. The eggs are greenish and beautifully sculptured with ridges and furrows on the surface. The fully grown caterpillar measures up to 60 mm and has a black head and a body with varying color pattern. The body has a velvety, appearance with a mid-dorsal black streak running longitudinally on a black background. The larval period lasts about 15-19 days and the total development about 33-41 days.","Monitor plant and collect older larvae or infected plant parts.; Go for a controlled insecticide use in order to not harm the populations of beneficial insects.; Build open space for birds that will feed on the larvae.; Use traps to monitor and catch the moths.; After harvest, leave the land open to expose the semiloopers to predators.",disease_images/Castor_Semilooper.jpg,400,299,JPEG,RGB
