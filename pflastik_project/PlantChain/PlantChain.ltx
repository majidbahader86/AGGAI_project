\section{Introduction}

Advancements in data-intensive fields such as Plants diseases and scientific research have underscored the critical need for secure and authentic data management systems. Traditional approaches often face challenges related to data integrity, transparency, and centralized control. Blockchain technology offers a promising solution by providing a decentralized and immutable ledger that ensures data integrity and security through cryptographic principles.

This project focuses on leveraging blockchain for secure data management, particularly in handling disease reports, scientific papers, datasets, and genetic sequences . The integration of genetic data adds a unique dimension, requiring specialized methods for data storage and authentication. The system utilizes SHA-256 hashing for robust cryptographic security and incorporates DNA sequence storage to facilitate future advancements in genetic research and personalized medicine.

The blockchain implementation presented in this paper comprises two core components: the \texttt{Blockchain} and \texttt{GenChain}. The \texttt{Blockchain} facilitates continuous block generation, secure data validation using RSA cryptography, and management of diverse data types. Meanwhile, the \texttt{GenChain} specializes in storing and authenticating genetic sequences , ensuring data integrity through specialized hashing and DNA sequence conversion.

In this paper, we discuss the mathematical concepts and functions underlying RSA cryptography and SHA-256 hashing, providing a comprehensive understanding of their role in securing our blockchain operations and data storage. We also introduce the \texttt{Block} and \texttt{GenChainBlock}  detailing their attributes and functionalities within the blockchain framework.

By demonstrating the implementation details and applications of blockchain technology in data management, this paper aims to showcase its potential in enhancing security, integrity, and efficiency across plant science field , and beyond.

\section{RSA Encryption and Signing}

\subsubsection{Key Pair Generation}

To generate an RSA key pair, the following steps are performed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item **Generate large primes \( p \) and \( q \)**: Two distinct large prime numbers are generated.
    \item **Compute the modulus**: 
    \begin{equation}
    n = p \times q
    \end{equation}
    \item **Compute the totient**: 
    \begin{equation}
    \phi(n) = (p-1) \times (q-1)
    \end{equation}
    \item **Select the public exponent**: 
    \begin{equation}
    e = 65537
    \end{equation}
    \item **Compute the private exponent \( d \)**: 
    \begin{equation}
    d \times e \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ \phi(n))
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

The public key consists of \( (e, n) \) and the private key consists of \( (d, n) \).

\subsubsection{Private Key Serialization}

The private key \( (d, n) \) is serialized to PEM format using PKCS8 without encryption. This allows for secure storage and transfer of the private key in a standard format.

\subsubsection{Public Key Serialization}

The public key \( (e, n) \) is serialized to PEM format using the SubjectPublicKeyInfo format. This standard format ensures compatibility across different systems and applications.

\subsubsection{Data Signing}

To sign data using the RSA algorithm:

\begin{align*}
\text{hash}(data) & \rightarrow \text{Apply a hash function (e.g., SHA-256) to the data} \\
\text{signature} &= \text{hash}(data)^d \mod n
\end{align*}

PSS (Probabilistic Signature Scheme) padding is applied to ensure security against certain types of attacks:
\begin{equation}
\text{PSS padding} = \text{PSS}(\text{hash}(data))
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Signature Verification}

To verify a signature:

\begin{align*}
\text{verification} &= \text{signature}^e \mod n \\
&= \text{hash}(data) \quad \text{if the signature is valid}
\end{align*}

PSS padding is used during verification to ensure the integrity of the hash function and the signed data:
\begin{equation}
\text{PSS padding} = \text{PSS}(\text{hash}(data))
\end{equation}

\section{SHA-256 Hashing Algorithm}

\subsection{Message Padding and Parsing}

SHA-256 processes the padded message \( M \) in 512-bit blocks:

\begin{equation}
M_{\text{padded}} = \text{pad}(M)
\end{equation}

The padded message \( M_{\text{padded}} \) is divided into 512-bit blocks for processing.

\subsection{Message Schedule}

Each 512-bit block is divided into 16 32-bit words, which are then extended to 64 words:

\begin{equation}
W_t^i = \begin{cases} 
M_t^i & \text{for } 0 \leq i < 16 \\
\sigma_1(W_{t-2}^i) + W_{t-7}^i + \sigma_0(W_{t-15}^i) + W_{t-16}^i & \text{for } 16 \leq i < 64 
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Compression Function}

For each 512-bit block \( M_t \):

\begin{align}
& \text{Initialize } H_0^t, H_1^t, \ldots, H_7^t \\
& \text{For } t = 0 \text{ to } 63: \\
& \quad a = H_0^t, b = H_1^t, c = H_2^t, d = H_3^t, e = H_4^t, f = H_5^t, g = H_6^t, h = H_7^t \\
& \quad \text{Compute } T_1 = h + \Sigma_1(e) + \text{Ch}(e,f,g) + K_t + W_t \\
& \quad \text{Compute } T_2 = \Sigma_0(a) + \text{Maj}(a,b,c) \\
& \quad h = g \\
& \quad g = f \\
& \quad f = e \\
& \quad e = d + T_1 \\
& \quad d = c \\
& \quad c = b \\
& \quad b = a \\
& \quad a = T_1 + T_2
\end{align}

Where:

\begin{align}
\Sigma_0(x) &= \text{ROTR}^2(x) \oplus \text{ROTR}^{13}(x) \oplus \text{ROTR}^{22}(x) \\
\Sigma_1(x) &= \text{ROTR}^6(x) \oplus \text{ROTR}^{11}(x) \oplus \text{ROTR}^{25}(x) \\
\text{Ch}(x,y,z) &= (x \land y) \oplus (\neg x \land z) \\
\text{Maj}(x,y,z) &= (x \land y) \oplus (x \land z) \oplus (y \land z)
\end{align}

\subsection{Final Hash Value}

Concatenate the outputs of each compression function to obtain the final hash value:

\begin{equation}
\text{Final Hash Value} = H_0^n \parallel H_1^n \parallel H_2^n \parallel H_3^n \parallel H_4^n \parallel H_5^n \parallel H_6^n \parallel H_7^n
\end{equation}
