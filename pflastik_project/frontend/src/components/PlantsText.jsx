        AggAI's 'Plants' page is a masterclass in botanical dissection, categorizing plants into five parts: Seeds, Roots, Leaves, Stems, and Flowers. Each section isn't just for showâ€”these plant parts hold the secret to detecting diseases with pinpoint accuracy. By breaking down the plant into these core components, AggAI has made disease tracking as modular as a LEGO set, but with a lot more scientific finesse. It's like giving each plant part a magnifying glass, letting you zoom in on potential health risks before they bloom into full-blown problems. This approach doesn't just cultivate knowledge; it harvests efficiency in disease detection.
